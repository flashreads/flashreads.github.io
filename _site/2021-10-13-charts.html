<h1 id="flowcharts">FLOWCHARTS</h1>

<p>What is a Flowchart? 
Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. 
The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”.</p>

<p>Terminal: The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in a program logic under some error conditions. Terminal is the first and last symbols in the flowchart.</p>

<p>Input/Output: A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart.</p>

<p>Processing: A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol.</p>

<p>Decision Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart.</p>

<p>Flow lines: Flow lines indicate the exact sequence in which instructions are executed. Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and relationship among different symbols of flowchart.</p>

<p>Advantages of Flowchart:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of system.</li>
  <li>Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.</li>
  <li>Flowcharts helps in debugging process.</li>
  <li>With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.</li>
  <li>It provides better documentation.</li>
  <li>Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages of Flowchart:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is difficult to draw flowchart for large and complex programs.</li>
  <li>In this their is no standard to determine the amount of detail.</li>
  <li>Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.</li>
  <li>It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.</li>
</ol>
