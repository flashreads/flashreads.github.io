<h1 id="css-image-display-fix">CSS Image DIsplay Fix</h1>

<p>You might or might not have noticed this, but when you inspect images on a webpage using your Dev Tools, there’s a small line underneath them, unless this was “fixed” by the developer.</p>

<p>This is not really a bug. It happens because images are inline elements, and once you look at the image below, you’ll begin getting the sense.</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/baseline.jpg" />
</div>

<p>The green line is the <strong>baseline</strong>, an invisble line on which elements “sit”. As you can see, some characters in the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">paragraph</code> go beyond this line, creating the red line you’re seeing. And since images are inline elements, they “sit” on the baseline relative to elements before or after them, leaving a whitespace between their base and the space created by characters going beyond the baseline.</p>

<p>To avoid this, just give the images a <code class="highlighter-rouge">display: 'block';</code></p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>img {
   display: block;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There, done! Now all images on your page won’t have that annoying whitespace as they will fill it up.</p>
