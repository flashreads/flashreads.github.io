<h2 id="what-is-the-dom">What is the DOM?</h2>

<p>Simply put, the DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree in the browser that keeps track of all elements (nodes) on the page as well as their attributes and properties.</p>

<p>At some point, you’d need to select an element from the DOM for various reasons. You might want to add an event listener, or change a style,etc. There are four main methods that can help us achieve this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>document.getElementById - Takes an Id and gets the first element with that Id.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>document.getElementsByClassName - Takes a class name and gets all elements with that class name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>document.querySelector - Takes a query and gets the first element matching that query.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>document.querySelectorAll - Takes a query and returns all elements matching that query.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Of the four methods above, the first two are the older and have been used for a very long time, hence, a lot of people know it and often teach it to others. I beg to differ though as my experience with 3 and 4 have been spectacular. They both take CSS-like queries as their input and working with them has greatly improved my speed. You can use them like so</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">querySelector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"div.box &gt; p"</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//Returns the p tag that is in a div with a class of box</span>
<span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">querySelectorAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"section.card h2"</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//Returns all the h2 tags that are children ( or grandchildren ) of</span>
<span class="c1">//  the section element with a class of tag</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the elements we got in the code snippet above, we’d have to add new Ids or classes to our elements which I feel is unnecessary. If you aren’t already using methods 3 and 4, I really do hope you switch. Thanks.</p>
