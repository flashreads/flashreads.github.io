<h2 id="react-js">React JS</h2>

<p>React is a Javascript library created by Facebook in 2013. It is used to create user interfaces and UI components. React JS is a popular library used by companies such as Reddit, Salesforce, Hulu, and Netflix due to its ability to create fast and dynamic websites.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>A component is a reusable peice of code. Much like a function, it is able to take in an input (props) to generate an output (React element).</p>

<p>In the example below, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> prop is passed into the Greeting component so that the Greeting component
can be reused multiple times with different names without repeating code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-JSX">import React from "react";

const Greeting = ({ name }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello {name}, I hope you're having a great day!&lt;/h1&gt;
    );
};

export default Greeting;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of the Greeting component being invoked with different names:</p>

<pre><code class="language-JSX">import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

const App = () =&gt; {
    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;Greeting name="Alex"/&gt;
            &lt;Greeting name="Rachel"/&gt;
            &lt;Greeting name="John"/&gt;
            &lt;Greeting name="Sammie"/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};

export default App
</code></pre>
