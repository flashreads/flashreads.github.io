    "body": "2022/02/27 - Checked versus Unchecked Java Exceptions: We can devide Java exceptions into three categories:: Errors and Exceptions can be frustrating at times, but at the end of the day we need to know how to solve them. That is what we do. This little blog will help you learn about the types of Java Exceptions and they mean. These three categories are broken down into checked and unchecked classifications—error and runtime exceptions. Errors and Runtime Exceptions are classified as an unchecked, which means are not checked at compile time and can result in runtime errors. Checked - these are exceptions that are checked by the compiler at compile time. These exceptions must be caught by a try/catch in the code or noted as thrown by the method. For instance, if a program attempts to access a file that is currently unavailable, the method to access the file must either catch or throw a FileNotFoundException. Error - errors are exceptions that happen externally to your Java program. One common example of the error is when the Java virtual machine (JVM) runs out of memory, which will throw an OutOfMemoryError. Runtime - runtime exceptions are internal to your application but are not typically recoverable. For example, an object that is expected to have a value but is actually null. In this case, a NullPointerException exception would be thrown. These three categories are broken down into checked and unchecked classifications—error and runtime exceptions and are grouped together as unchecked, which, per their name, are not checked at compile time and can result in runtime errors.

    "body": "2022/02/27 - What is a NullPointerException?: java. lang. NullPointerException is a runtime exception in Java. It occurs when a variable is accessed which is not pointing to any object and refers to nothing hence it is null. Since the NullPointerException is a runtime exception, it doesn’t need to be caught and handled explicitly in application code. What are the reasons for getting NullPointerException?: The NullPointerException occurs due to a situation in where an uninitialized object is attempted to be accessed. This means the object reference does not point anywhere and has a null value. Some of the most common scenarios for a NullPointerException are: Accessing a null object’s properties: Throwing null from a method that throws an exception: Incorrect configuration for dependency injection frameworks ex:(Spring): Passing null parameters to a method: Calling methods on a null object: Using synchronized on a null object: Accessing an index element (like in an array) of a null object: Example of a NullPointerException: In this example we are trying to call a printLength methos which accepts a String as a parameter and prints its length.

    "body": "2021/10/31 - Type CastingType casting is when the data type of a variable is casted to another type. There are two types of casting: Widening and Narrowing. Converting a Variable’s Type Using Widening Casting: With this type of casting, there is no extra code that needs to be written. Java does this for you under the hood when a smaller type is converted to a larger type. When dealing with numbers, a byte is the smallest data type (whole numbers from -128 to 127), then a short (whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767), int (whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), long (whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807), float (fractional numbers with 6 to 7 decimal places), and double (fractional numbers with 15 decimal places). 1234567  int intType = 2021;  // casting at assignment  float floatType = intType; // Outputs 2021. 0Converting a Variable’s Type Using Narrowing Casting: This casting is used when converting from a larger data type to a smaller type. For example, converting from a long to an int requires Narrowing casting. For example: 12345678910111213141516171819  long longType = 2000000L;  // Cast by wrapping the desired type in parentheses before the value  int intType = (int) longType; // Outputs 2000000  // won't work if the long value is greater or less than int's range  longType = 3000000000L; // greater than the upper limit of int type  // the data is cast to an int  // since the long value is out of int's range, Java tries converting to a value within range  intType = (int) longType; // Outputs -1294967296Typecasting WYNTK: Typecasting doesn’t work for all data classes. Some may wonder if you can convert a char to a String and vice versa. Primitive data types are the only data types that can be casted in this manner. And since the String class is not a primitive type, it’s not allowed. There are, however, built in methods in the String class that help do this; like the String. valueOf(char c) method and in the Character class like Character. toString(char c). "

That is, its properties and specifications are related to rows or columns. This is different from a CSS grid that has both rows and columns in two dimensions at the same time. You can use Flexbox to create grid layouts by nesting containers and elements. How to Use Flexbox: Flexbox consists of a alot of properties, the first step is using Flexbox is by invoking it with the display property.  display : flex;Then we have the “flex-direction” property tells your container which direction its items should go in and therefore also says which direction the main-axis is going in. for example :- flex-direction : column;We also have the “flex-wrap” property which tells your code whether its items are allowed to wrap to the next line, like the lines on the page of a book, or whether they need to stay forced onto one line. an example is :- flex-wrap : wrap;Flexbox has other Properties that you can learn here :- https://developer. mozilla. org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox "

    "body": "2021/10/30 - Arrays vs. ArrayListsAlthough ‘arrays’ and ‘Arraylists’ both store information in the form of lists, one of the most fundamental differences between the two is how an array is a ‘fixed legnth data structure’ while an Arraylist is a ‘variable length Collection class’. This means that the legnth of an array cannot be cahnced after being created, but the legnth of an Arraylist can. In addition, since ArrayList implements the Collection interface, it can only store ‘objects’, whereas arrays can store both ‘objects’ and ‘primitives’ such as int, boolean, char, etc. To make an ArrayList of integers, for example, we would need to convert integers into an object. Declaring ArraysThere are two ways to declare and initialize arryas: ## 1) Declaring and initializing at the same time Example: 123456789101112131415public static void main(String args) { int[] numList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; }Here, the declaring part - which declares the type and name of the array - and the initializing part - which initializes the elements in the arrays - are combined into one line. ## 2) Declaring then initializing later Example: 123456789101112131415161718192021public static void main(String args) {  int[] numList = new int[7]; numList[0] = 1; numList[1] = 2; numList[6] = 7; }Here, we first declared the type, name, and length of the array. Then, initialized by assigning a value to each index of the array. Declaring ArrayListsLike declaring arrays, there are multiple ways to declare ArrayLists as well 1) Initialization with add(): Example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425public static void main(String args) { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; example = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();  example. add( this ); example. add( is ); example. add( an ); example. add( example ); } Here, we first created the ArrayList with the type (String) and the name (example). Then, we initialized the elements with add(). ## 2) Initialize using asList() Example: 1234567891011121314151617 public static void main(String args[]) {  ArrayList&lt;String&gt; example = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(  Arrays. asList( this ,  is ,  an ,  example ));  }Here, the ArrayList is declared and initialized all at once by initializing the Strings using asList(). 3) Initialize using List. of(): Example: 1234567891011121314151617public static void main(String args[]) { List&lt;String&gt; example = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(  List. of( this ,  is ,  an ,  example ));  }List asList(), this method declared and initialized the ArrayList all at once.

Say, you want to extract the emojis from the reviews because they are a good predictor os the sentiment of the review. Take another example, the artificial assistants such as Siri, Google Now use information retrieval to give you better results. When you ask them for any query or ask them to search for something interesting on the screen, they look for common patterns such as emails, phone numbers, place names, date and time and so on. This is because then the assitant can automatically make a booking or ask you to call the resturant to make a booking. Regular expressions are very powerful tool in text processing.

    "body": "2021/10/27 - ERRORSError results in abnormal working of the program. Some errors dont let the program to be compiled meanwhile some errors occur during execution after succesful compilation. Based on this factor errors are classified into three main types. Types Of Errors: There are three types of errors in Java    Syntax errors     Logical errors     Runtime errors (Exception)  1. Syntax errors: These are the errors which occur when our compiler finds violation of Java syntax in our program. It is also called as compile time error as it is detected by the compiler. Example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031public static void main(String args[]){  //Semicolon missing  int a=9  // semicolon missing  int b=3+a;  System. print. println(b);  // Datatype missing   d=3456;}2. Logical errors: These are also called as bugs. This occurs when the program compiles and runs but the expected output is not received when certain input is given. These happen due to not using appropriate logic in the program by the user. Example: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627public static void main(String args[]){    // Find product of a and b  int a = 34;  int b=0;    int c= a/b;  System. out. println( product of a and b is +c);  //But here c is the quotient not the product of a and b}3. Runtime errors: These errors are encountered while the program is executing. They get successfully compiled but throw an exception while running. These are also called Exceptions. They are hard to find as compiler doesnt point at the line where the error as ocurred. Example: 123456789101112131415161718192021public static void main(String args[]){    //Number divided by 0 is not defined  int a = 34;  int b=0;  int c= a/b;  System. out. println(c);}"

Java offers a Random. nextInt(int bound) method, which gives you a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and the bound (exclusive). We can use this method to generate a random number between a and b: 1234567891011121314151617public static int nextRandomIntBetween(int a, int b) {  if (b &lt;= a) {    throw new IllegalArgumentException( b must be greater than a );  }  int m = b - a;  Random random = new Random();  return random. nextInt(m) + a;}First, we must ensure that b is greater than a. nextInt(int bound) does not accept negative values. Then, we calculate the difference b - a. This is the range of our random integers and we can use this to generate random number between 0 and b - a. Finally, we add the value of a to the random number, which will make the random number exactly in the range we wanted. Here is the full example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455package com. flashreads. examples;import java. security.

The typical usage of such generated numbers and values is when you need to generate a secret key/password or other random bytes which are hard to guess and most often used in authentication/authorization flows, or when generating random secret keys for encryption. To generate a cryptographically secure random numbers or sequences in Java, you should use SecureRandom.

Operator is a special function that is written differently than a regular function, Generally operator take two parameters and return one result. Lets say you want to create a variable 12345const a = 5 + 4;console. log(a);I bet you can guess what the result is 1239;Correct 9, obviously 5 + 4 is equal to 9, but there is a question you may ask, “How the Javascript do that?” or “How Javascript know that 5 + 4 is an addition?”. Well, first the Javascript engine will see the + sign and add the numbers in between which is 5 and 4. The + sign is an operators and it’s actually a function, kinda like this: 1234567function +(num1, num2) { return // sum the two numbers}The function will run as soon as the Javascript see this 5 + 4 line of code, the different is instead calling the function normally like +(5, 4) the Javascript engine provide an ability to write a Infix notation. Infix simply mean the function + sit between the two parametes. To get an idea how it work we will compare Prefix, Infix and Postfix notation. Prefix Notation equal to +5 4 the + sign sit in the beginning \ Infix Notation equal to 5 + 4 the + sign sit in the middle \ Postfix Notation equal to 5 4+ the + sign sit in the end You can see the Infix notation sit between the two parameters, but in the end it’s just a function and return a value. In this case the + operator get called and return 5 and 4 added together. The - operator work exactly the same for example: 12345const a = 3 - 2;console. log(a);I think you can already guess the result, it’s 1 because - is an operator a minus sign. or you can do another one 12345const a = 3 &gt; 2;console. log(a);&gt; the greater than is just a function, a special function, this operator work the same way except that this operator return a Boolean value. Whenever you write +, -, &lt;, &gt; and all other operators out there that this is just a special types of function. The two parametes is being passed to the function and the function have a pre written code inside of it that Javascript engine provide for you and then it will return a value it could be a Number, Boolean etc. So please keep in mind that operators is just a function.

    "body": "2021/10/23 - Data Validation in Node. js Applications Using JoiEvery application built consists of data. Be it a Web, Mobile or even Console based application, data is either displayed or accepted from a user as an input. Before you store the user input recieved, data validation is highly recommended to prevent the risk of a malicious SQL query being executed on your database. You can perform the data validation directly from the client side application where the input is recieved, and also at your server side application, before the data is stored. A Node. js package which you can use to perform data validation in Node. js applications is Joi. Let’s proceed to get simplified understanding of Joi and see examples of how it can be used. What is Joi?: As described in the Joi documentation, “Joi is a data validator library for JavaScript”. Joi’s comprehensive API provides support for validating the data type of a value, and can also be extended to validate properties of a string. For example, checking the length of a string, or checking if a value is a valid email, or date within a specified range. The first step to take when using Joi is to construct a schema. At it’s basics, a Joi schema is an object with fields that model the data being validated agaisnt. Let’s proceed to construct a schema for a user’s data within an imaginary application. Modeling A User Data Schema: For the imaginary application, we would expect that a user’s data must contain the following three fields;    A name field containing a string data type that has a minimum length of 5 characters and a maximum character count of 25     A description field similar to the name field, but has a minimum acceptable character count of 50 and maximum count of 300.     An email field containing a string data type with the “@” character. The email must have a Top Level Domain (TLD) of “. com”. A TLD is the last part of a domain, that is after the dot (. ) character.   const Joi = require( joi ) const userSchema = Joi. object({  name: Joi. string(). min(3). max(25). required(),  description: Joi. string(). alphanum(). min(50). max(250). required(),  email: Joi. string(). email({   tlds: { allow: [ com ] }  }). required() });Note: Based on the needs for your application, you might have more fields within your schema. Visit the API section of the Joi documentation for a complete list of Joi’s API. Validating Values Using The Schema: At this point there is now a userSchema variable contain a Joi schema that models a user application. Let’s go through the next code snipet below that explains how the schmea can be used. You can validate data using the schema by calling the assert method within the schema object and passing in the data to be validated agaisnt. The snippet below demonstrates how this is done; const validateData = ({ name, description, email }) =&gt; { try {   Joi. assert({ name, description, email }, userSchema); } catch (e) {  console. log(`Erorr validating data: ${e}`) }}validateData({  name:  John Doe ,  description:  Some pretty long and organized description of me the author ,  email: 'john. doe@gmail. com'})When the validateData function in the code snippet above is executed, the name, description andemail arguments passed to the function will be validated using the assert method in the try/catch block. If the values don’t meet up with the validation standards, an exception will thrown and handled the catch block. This forms the basic usage of the Joi Schema to for validating your data. You can also use the validate and attempt methods depending on your application’s needs. "

Like other web developers, I learned by copying and pasting code and testing different things out or even reading W3School pages so I can write my own code. But one thing that goes missing when web developers first learn to make website is web accessibility. What is Web Accessibility?:       Chances are, regardless of where you spend your time on the internet, you’ve heard about web accessibility recently. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines web accessibility as “[when] websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them” [Introduction to Web Accessibility   Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)   W3C](https://www. w3. org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#what). Disabilities can range anywhere from auditory, physical, visual, speech, to cognitive. Web accessibility can also benefit those without disabilities - whether you have a situational limitation, a temporary disability (like a broken arm), if you have limited bandwidth with your Internet connection, and even as you age.    Things to Look For: So how does someone start implementing accessibility in their projects? Great question! First and foremost, web accessibility should be implemented from the start. Placing it at the end isn’t impossible but this can cause more work and in some cases, it can be costly. Color Contrast: Color contrast is one of the “low hanging fruit” when it comes to accessibility. If you place white text on a white background, will you be able to read it? What about black text on a black background? One thing to keep in mind for color contrast is if your background is light, use dark text (and vice versa). Text on background color contrast must meet 4. 5:1 and non-text color contrast must meet at least 3:1. (But these can be higher!) Here’s a link to a contrast checker! WebAIM: Contrast Checker Text Alternatives for Images: Creating alt text for images is another quick and easy way to add accessibility to your website. # &lt;img src= https://www. google. com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp. png &gt;What’s wrong with the code example above? It seems correct, right? You have your image tag, it doesn’t need to be closed, and you have a URL linking to the image. We’re missing alt text! Here’s how we correct it: # &lt;img src= https://www. google. com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp. png  alt= Google logo &gt;There we go! In this example, we added the alt attribute and a text value to our image. So now, when screenreader users move over the image, they may hear something along the lines of “image Google logo”. This is extremely beneficial for screenreader users who are blind. Here’s a great article on image alt text WebAIM: Alternative Text Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG): While I could write more and more about web accessibility, I’ll leave the journey to you! There are some wonderful accessibility resources out there but the accessibility “source of truth” comes from W3C. It’s called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines "

    "title": "JavaScript Promise Async/Await Functions",
    "body": "2021/10/20 - Promise Async/Await FunctionsIn javascript there are 2 ways to tame the asynchronous beast. You need to use the following Functions:    Promise (then/catch) introduced in ES6     Async/Await introduced in ES7  These 2 syntaxes gives exactly same underlying functionality, however the readability and scope is different. We will explore how they helps us in generating maintainable code, while other functions make chaos :boom: . In this snippet we will see in example how we can relate the daily household task into JS understanding. JavaScript runs code line by line, moving to the next line of code only after the previous one has been executed. But executing code like this can only take us so far. Sometimes, we need to perform tasks that take a long or unpredictable amount of time to complete: fetching data or triggering side-effects via an API, for example. Rather than letting these tasks block JavaScript’s main thread, the language allows us to run certain tasks in parallel. ES6 saw the introduction of the Promise object as well as new methods to handle the execution of these Promises: then, catch, and finally. But a year later, in ES7, the language added another approach and two new keywords: async and await. In my opinion, unless a library or legacy codebase forces you to use then/catch, the better choice for readability and maintainability is async/await. To demonstrate that, we’ll use both syntaxes to solve the daily household tasks. then, catch And finallythen and catch and finally are methods of the Promise object, and they are chained one after the other. Each takes a callback function as its argument and returns a Promise. As example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849// First you need to buy some vegges from groceryconst grocery = new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {  if(shopOpen){   resolve('buy the grocery');  }else{   reject('it is a holiday, shop closed');  } });// Then you need to chop the vegges into piecesconst chopping = new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {  resolve('vegges are chopped'); });// Finally you can cook the foodconst cooking = new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {  resolve('food is ready'); });Using then, catch and finally, we could perform a series of actions based on whether the Promise is resolved (then) or rejected (catch) — while finally allows us to execute code once the Promise is settled, regardless of whether it was resolved or rejected: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839// Let's do cookinggrocery . then((value) =&gt; {  chopping   . then((value) =&gt; {     cooking      . then((value) =&gt; {       // Food      })   }) }). catch((error) =&gt; {  // it is a holiday, shop closed }) . finally(() =&gt; {  // take water });async And awaitBy contrast, async and await are keywords which make synchronous-looking code asynchronous. We use async when defining a function to signify that it returns a Promise. Notice how the placement of the async keyword depends on whether we’re using regular functions or arrow functions: 12345678910111213141516171819async function doSomethingAsynchronous() { // logic}const doSomethingAsynchronous = async () =&gt; { // logic};await, meanwhile, is used before a Promise. It pauses the execution of an asynchronous function until the Promise is resolved. For example, to await our grocery above, we could write: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223const grocery = async () { try {  const value = await 'buy the grocery';  return value } catch (e) {  const value = await 'it is a holiday, shop closed';  return value }}Then you can still use the same pattern 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627// Let's do cookinggrocery . then((value) =&gt; {  // Do Something }). catch((error) =&gt; {  // it is a holiday, shop closed }) . finally(() =&gt; {  // take water });"

If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function len() to get the length of a string.

It has the following form: 12345678910111213def name_of_function(arg1,arg2):  '''  This is where the function's Document String (docstring) goes  '''  # Do stuff here  # Return desired resultExample 1: A simple print ‘hello’ function: 1234567891011def say_hello():  print('hello')#Call the Functionsay_hello()Example 2: A simple greeting function: Let’s write a function that greets people with their name. 123456789def greeting(name):  print('Hello %s' %(name))greeting('Jose') #calling the functionUsing return: Let’s see an example that use a return statement. return allows a function to return a result that can then be stored as a variable, or used in whatever manner a user wants. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425import mathdef is_prime2(num):  '''  Better method of checking for primes.   '''  if num % 2 == 0 and num &gt; 2:     return False  for i in range(3, int(math. sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):    if num % i == 0:      return False  return TrueGreat! You should now have a basic understanding of creating your own functions to save yourself from repeatedly writing code! "

There are two key differences: arrow functions are always anonymous and are non-binding of ‘this’. Before: 1234567hello = function() { return  Hello World! ;};After: 1234567hello = () =&gt; { return  Hello World! ;};It can be even shorter if the function has only ONE statement that returns a value. Example: 123hello = () =&gt;  Hello World! ;How to Use Parameters: 123hello = (param) =&gt;  Hello   + param;OR without parenthesis 123hello = (param) =&gt;  Hello   + param;How to Handle ‘this’: Regular functions always define its ‘this’ value but arrow functions treat ‘this’ keyword differently. They do not define their own context since it doesn’t have its own ‘this’ context. It is inherited from the parent scope whenever you call ‘this’. Example: Regular Function: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425var obj = { count: 10, doSomethingLater: function() {  setTimeout(function() {   // the function executes on the window scope   this. count++;   console. log(this. count);  }, 300); },};obj. doSomethingLater(); // result is  NaN , because the property  count  is not in the window scope.

It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”. Terminal: The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in a program logic under some error conditions. Terminal is the first and last symbols in the flowchart. Input/Output: A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart. Processing: A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol. Decision Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart. Flow lines: Flow lines indicate the exact sequence in which instructions are executed. Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and relationship among different symbols of flowchart. Advantages of Flowchart:    Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of system.     Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.     Flowcharts helps in debugging process.     With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.     It provides better documentation.     Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.  Disadvantages of Flowchart:    It is difficult to draw flowchart for large and complex programs.     In this their is no standard to determine the amount of detail.     Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.     It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.  "

Methods are a key concept of the OOP paradigm. They are essential to dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications. You can basically think of methods as functions acting on an Object that take the Object itself into account through its self argument. Let’s go through an example of creating a Circle class: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647class Circle:  pi = 3. 14  # Circle gets instantiated with a radius (default is 1)  def __init__(self, radius=1):    self. radius = radius     self. area = radius * radius * Circle. pi  # Method for resetting Radius  def setRadius(self, new_radius):    self. radius = new_radius    self. area = new_radius * new_radius * self. pi  # Method for getting Circumference  def getCircumference(self):    return self. radius * self. pi * 2c = Circle()print('Radius is: ',c. radius)print('Area is: ',c. area)print('Circumference is: ',c. getCircumference())In the init method above, in order to calculate the area attribute, we had to call Circle. pi. This is because the object does not yet have its own . pi attribute, so we call the Class Object Attribute pi instead. In the setRadius method, however, we’ll be working with an existing Circle object that does have its own pi attribute. Here we can use either Circle. pi or self. pi. Now let’s change the radius and see how that affects our Circle object: 1234567891011c. setRadius(2)print('Radius is: ',c. radius)print('Area is: ',c. area)print('Circumference is: ',c. getCircumference())Great! Notice how we used self. notation to reference attributes of the class within the method calls. Review how the code above works and try creating your own method. "

    "body": "2021/10/12 - Generators and Iterators in PythonGenerator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off. This type of function is a generator in Python, allowing us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a yield statement. In most aspects, a generator function will appear very similar to a normal function. The main difference is when a generator function is compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol. That means when they are called in your code they don’t actually return a value and then exit. Instead, generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation ￼￼ To start getting a better understanding of generators, let’s go ahead and see how we can create some. 123456789101112131415# Generator function for the cube of numbers (power of 3)def gencubes(n):  for num in range(n):    yield num**3for x in gencubes(10):  print(x)Generators are best for calculating large sets of results (particularly in calculations that involve loops themselves) in cases where we don’t want to allocate the memory for all of the results at the same time. Let’s create another example generator which calculates fibonacci numbers: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627# Generator function for the cube of numbers (power of 3)def genfibon(n):       Generate a fibonnaci sequence up to n       a = 1  b = 1  for i in range(n):    yield a    a,b = b,a+bfor num in genfibon(10):  print(num)next() built-in function in Python: A key to fully understanding generators is the next() function and the iter() function. The next() function allows us to access the next element in a sequence. Lets check it out: 12345678910111213141516171819# Generator function for the cube of numbers (power of 3)def simple_gen():  for x in range(3):    yield x# Assign simple_gen g = simple_gen()print(next(g)) #prints out a value in the generatoriter() built-in Fuction in Python: Let’s go ahead and check out how to use iter() A string object supports iteration, We can directly iterate over a string with The iter() function. 12345678910111213141516171819s = 'hello'#Iterate over stringfor let in s:  print(let)s_iter = iter(s)next(s_iter) # print each of the value in s when called The main takeaway from this article is that using the yield keyword at a function will cause the function to become a generator.

Objects that we can iterate over include strings, lists, tuples, and even built-in iterables for dictionaries, such as keys or values. Using For Loops in a List: 1234567list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]for num in list1:  print(num) # Prints out each number in list1Using For Loops in a String: We’ve used for loops with lists, how about with strings? Remember strings are a sequence so when we iterate through them we will be accessing each item in that string. 12345for letter in 'This is a string. ':  print(letter) #print each letter in the stringUsing For Loops in Tuples: Tuples have a special quality when it comes to for loops. If you are iterating through a sequence that contains tuples, the item can actually be the tuple itself, this is an example of tuple unpacking. During the for loop we will be unpacking the tuple inside of a sequence and we can access the individual items inside that tuple! 123456789101112131415list2 = [(2,4),(6,8),(10,12)]for tup in list2:  print(tup) #prints each tuple# Now with unpacking!for (t1,t2) in list2:  print(t1)Using For Loops in a Dictionary: Cool! With tuples in a sequence we can access the items inside of them through unpacking! The reason this is important is because many objects will deliver their iterables through tuples. Let’s start exploring iterating through Dictionaries to explore this further! 12345678910111213141516171819d = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3} #This is a Dictionary in pythonfor item in d:  print(item) #This prints out each keys in the dictionary# Dictionary unpacking for both keys and valuesfor k,v in d. items():  print(k)  print(v) We have learned how to use for loops to iterate through tuples, lists, strings, and dictionaries.

    "title": "Insertion Sort in Python",
    "body": "2021/10/12 - Insertion Sort in PythonInsertion Sort is type of sorting algorithm that is relatively simple to implement. It does not have the best runtime, i. e. O(n^2), compared to more advanced sorting algorithms such as quicksort or merge sort but is a good starting sorting algorithm to learn. It can be used to sort smaller arrays consisting of strings or numbers. Pseudocode: Here is the pseudocode of insertion code (from wikipedia): 12345678910111213141516171819i ← 1while i &lt; length(A)  j ← i  while j &gt; 0 and A[j-1] &gt; A[j]    swap A[j] and A[j-1]    j ← j - 1  end while  i ← i + 1end whileThe general idea behind it is to iterate through the array from beginning to end and swaps each element from the current element to the beginning of the array if a “greater” prior element is found compare to the current element. It basically sorts “subsections” of the array repeatedly until the entire array is sorted by “inserting” new elements in the right order in the subsection of the array. Python Implementation: Without further ado, here is my Python (3) implementation of it: 123456789101112131415161718192021def insertion_sort(array):  for i in range(1, len(array)):    j = i    while j &gt; 0 and array[j - 1] &gt; array[j]:      # swap the two array elements      temp = array[j - 1]      array[j - 1] = array[j]      array[j] = temp      j -= 1  return arrayAs you can see, it closely follows the pseudocode, with some minimal code savings using the range function. The swap was implemented inline but could be implemented as a separate function as well. Runtime: As mentioned, the average runtime for this algorithm is O(n^2). The best case is an array that is already sorted with a runtime of O(n) as the current element in the array will only be compared once with a prior element. The worst case is an array that is sorted in reverse as each new element will need to be compared (and swapped) with every prior element to the beginning of the array.

These data structures are in built that come along with python and we also have user defined data structure. List:: Lists are the type of container which can store data of different types in the memory. Lists are created using ‘[]’(square braces) Example: 123l1=[34,56,78,'list',(2,3)]Sets:: Sets are again similar to lists and tuples but diffrence would be it does not store duplicate values. It is enclosed in curly braces{} Example: 123s1={2,45,(4. 5,7),s}Tuple:: Tuple is similar to Lists but the diffrence is tuples are immutable where lists are mutable. Tuples are created using round braces() Example: 123t1=(1,2,3,(67,78),'tuple')Dictionary:: Okay now dictionary are not at all like lists. These data structures store key-value pair. Take an anology of a dictionary where there is a word and a meaning to that. Dictionaries in python are created using curly braces. Example: 123d1={1:a,2:b,3:c}Some of the user defined data structures are as follows: Array:: These data structures are similar to lists but it is homogeneous that is the elements having same datatype. Linked list:: These are the data structure that holds the value of next element using pointers. Stack:: These data structure follow the principle of last in first out. Basically, we can access only the last entered value. We can also do operations like push or pop. Queue:: These are the data structures that work following the principle of first in first out. You totally relate it to a queue in real life. Hash maps:: Hash maps are same as dictionaries in python. Graph:: Graphs stores the data in the collection of points called vertices and edges. "

    "title": "List Comprehension In Python",
    "body": "2021/10/11 - What Is A List Comprehension: List comprehensions are a really cool way to add data to a list in python, from within the list itself. For example, say we wanted to populate a list with numbers from 0-5, we could use a for loop to accomplish this as follows: 12345678910111213nums = []for i in range(6):  nums. append(i)print(nums)Which would result in the following 123[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]Doing this would give us an array that contains numbers from 0 - 5 , just like we wanted however there’s a much cooler way to achieve this, and moreso its a “one-liner”. Let’s see how: 1234567nums = [x for x in range(6)]print(nums)This took us from roughly 5 lines of code to one!. So let me explain what just happened. To create a list comprehension, you create a list first and then add logic for the data inside the square brackets. Usually it follows this template: 123array = [x(placeholder variable) (for statement)]   x: is the placeholder variable and represents every item in the list. It’s exactly like the for loop variable in the first example i. It is always the first part of the list comprehension     for statement: this is the for-loop that populates the list with actual values for x, and can take any form you want, you could even have conditional blocks in it.  Let’s see an example of list comprehension that uses conditional statements in it. If we wanted to populate a list with letters or characters from a word except vowels in it we could use a list comprehension to accomplish that as follows: 1234567891011vowels = 'aeiou'letters = [x for x in  apple  if x not in vowels]print(letters)This would result in the following: 123['p', 'p', 'l']We could also include an else statement however we need to put the if and else block before the for loop. 1234567891011vowels = 'aeiou'letters = [x if x not in vowels else 0 for x in  apple ]print(letters)This would result in the following: 123[0, 'p', 'p', 'l', 0]This is obviously a much easier way to populate your lists in python and can come in handy when you don’t have the luxury of writing a full loop. Have fun coding!. "

    "title": "The JavaScript Event Loop",
    "body": "2021/10/10 - What are Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript?: You may already know that the JavaScript V8 engine executes on a single thread, which means if there are synchronous operations that take longer periods of time, they would inturn block the subsequent synchronous operations. Therefore, JavaScript uses asynchronous operations in order to prevent blocking during code execution. In the JavaScript engine, we have the following components:    Call Stack     Event Loop     WEB APIs environment     Call-back Queue     Micro-task Queue  Whenever there is any asynchronous task, JS moves it to the WEB APIs Environment, for example, when you have an img tag with a very large image in the “src” attribute, this image is not downloaded synchronously, because that would block the thread, instead it is moved into the WEB API Environment where the image is loaded. 1234567&lt;img src= largeimg. jpg  /&gt;Now, if you want to do something once the image is loaded, you will need to listen to the image’s ‘load’ event. 123456789document. querySelector('img'). addEventListener('load', () =&gt; console. log('Image has been loaded!'));Now once the image has been loaded, this callback function is still not executed, instead now it is moved into the Callback queue. The callback function waits in the callback queue, the event loop will check for synchronous code, and wait until the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty, the event loop will push in a first in callback function into the call stack in one event loop tick. And that is when that call back function is executed. However, this changes when there are micro-tasks such as Promises. When there is a promise, it is sent to the microtask queue. Microtasks will always have priority over the callbacks and they can and will halt the callbacks until they are executed, event loop will always prioritize microtasks. This is how the JavaScript Call Stack, Event Loop, Call Back Queue, Microtasks Queue and WEB API Environments work. An Example: Here is a code snippet that can gives more clarity on the sequence of execution in JavaScript: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455//Synchronous Code - Always prioritized over async codeconsole. log('Asynchronous TEST start');//It is a 0 Second Timer, But a timer is not a microtasksetTimeout(() =&gt; console. log('0 sec timer'), 0);//Promise is a microtaskPromise. resolve('Resolved promise 1'). then(res =&gt; console. log(res));//2nd promise is a microtask tooPromise. resolve('Resolved promise 2'). then(res =&gt; {for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1000000000; i++) {} //very large loopconsole. log(res);}); //Synchronous Code - Always prioritized over async codeconsole. log('Test end');"

    "body": "2021/10/10 - What is the DOM?: Simply put, the DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree in the browser that keeps track of all elements (nodes) on the page as well as their attributes and properties. At some point, you’d need to select an element from the DOM for various reasons. You might want to add an event listener, or change a style,etc. There are four main methods that can help us achieve this:    document. getElementById - Takes an Id and gets the first element with that Id.     document. getElementsByClassName - Takes a class name and gets all elements with that class name.     document. querySelector - Takes a query and gets the first element matching that query.     document. querySelectorAll - Takes a query and returns all elements matching that query.  Of the four methods above, the first two are the older and have been used for a very long time, hence, a lot of people know it and often teach it to others. I beg to differ though as my experience with 3 and 4 have been spectacular. They both take CSS-like queries as their input and working with them has greatly improved my speed. You can use them like so 1234567document. querySelector( div. box &gt; p ); //Returns the p tag that is in a div with a class of boxdocument. querySelectorAll( section. card h2 ); //Returns all the h2 tags that are children ( or grandchildren ) of// the section element with a class of tagTo get the elements we got in the code snippet above, we’d have to add new Ids or classes to our elements which I feel is unnecessary. If you aren’t already using methods 3 and 4, I really do hope you switch. Thanks. "

    "body": "2021/10/09 - What is Binary search Trees?: Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. There must be no duplicate nodes. ###Pros of a BST    When balanced, a BST provides lightning-fast O(log(n)) insertions, deletions, and lookups.     Binary search trees are pretty simple. An ordinary BST, unlike a balanced tree like a red-black tree, requires very little code to get running.  ###Cons of a BST    Slow for a brute-force search. If you need to iterate over each node, you might have more success with an array.     When the tree becomes unbalanced, all fast O(log(n)) operations quickly degrade to O(n).     Since pointers to whole objects are typically involved, a BST can require quite a bit more memory than an array, although this depends on the implementation.  There are many applications of binary search trees in real life, and one of the most common use cases is storing indexes and keys in a database. For example, when you create a primary key column in MySQL or PostgresQL, you create a binary tree where the keys are the values of the column and the nodes point to database rows. This allows the application to easily search for database rows by specifying a key, for example, to find a user record using the email primary key. Code Example : # Binary Search Tree operations in Python# Create a nodeclass Node:  def __init__(self, key):    self. key = key    self. left = None    self. right = None# Inorder traversaldef inorder(root):  if root is not None:    # Traverse left    inorder(root. left)    # Traverse root    print(str(root. key) +  -&gt; , end=' ')    # Traverse right    inorder(root. right)# Insert a nodedef insert(node, key):  # Return a new node if the tree is empty  if node is None:    return Node(key)  # Traverse to the right place and insert the node  if key &lt; node. key:    node. left = insert(node. left, key)  else:    node. right = insert(node. right, key)  return node# Find the inorder successordef minValueNode(node):  current = node  # Find the leftmost leaf  while(current. left is not None):    current = current. left  return current# Deleting a nodedef deleteNode(root, key):  # Return if the tree is empty  if root is None:    return root  # Find the node to be deleted  if key &lt; root. key:    root. left = deleteNode(root. left, key)  elif(key &gt; root. key):    root. right = deleteNode(root. right, key)  else:    # If the node is with only one child or no child    if root. left is None:      temp = root. right      root = None      return temp    elif root. right is None:      temp = root. left      root = None      return temp    # If the node has two children,    # place the inorder successor in position of the node to be deleted    temp = minValueNode(root. right)    root. key = temp. key    # Delete the inorder successor    root. right = deleteNode(root. right, temp. key)  return rootroot = Noneroot = insert(root, 8)root = insert(root, 3)root = insert(root, 1)root = insert(root, 6)root = insert(root, 7)root = insert(root, 10)root = insert(root, 14)root = insert(root, 4)print( Inorder traversal:  , end=' ')inorder(root)print( \nDelete 10 )root = deleteNode(root, 10)print( Inorder traversal:  , end=' ')inorder(root)"

    "body": "2021/10/05 - Jenkins PipelineJenkins Pipeline is a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline and has automated expression of processes that enables the code to move from the version control system and through all the processes of testing and deployment, so that the best and reliable built is handed over to your end users and customers. Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines “as code” via the Pipeline domain-specific language (DSL) syntax. Creating a Jenkinsfile and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:: 1. Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests. 2. Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code). 3. Audit trail for the Pipeline. 4. Single source of truth for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple members of the project. Why Pipeline?: Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto Jenkins, supporting use cases that span from simple continuous integration to comprehensive CD pipelines. By modeling a series of related tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of Pipeline: 1234567891011  1. Code: Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their delivery pipeline.  2. Durable: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins controller.  3. Pausable: Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run.  4. Versatile: Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel.  5. Extensible: The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL [1] and multiple options for integration with other plugins. Pipeline concepts: The following concepts are key aspects of Jenkins Pipeline, which tie in closely to Pipeline syntax. Pipeline: A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipeline’s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it. Node: A node is a machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing a Pipeline. Stage: A stage block defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire Pipeline (e. g. “Build”, “Test” and “Deploy” stages), which is used by many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress. [6] Step: A single task. Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time (or “step” in the process). For example, to execute the shell command make use the sh step: sh ‘make’. When a plugin extends the Pipeline DSL, [1] that typically means the plugin has implemented a new step.

Read more about stage blocks in Declarative Pipeline syntax on the Pipeline syntax page. As mentioned above, stage blocks are optional in Scripted Pipeline syntax. 4. steps is Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax that describes the steps to be run in this stage. 5. sh is a Pipeline step (provided by the Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin) that executes the given shell command. 6. junit is another Pipeline step (provided by the JUnit plugin) for aggregating test reports. 7. node is Scripted Pipeline-specific syntax that instructs Jenkins to execute this Pipeline (and any stages contained within it), on any available agent/node. This is effectively equivalent to agent in Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax. More On Jenkins Pipeline at:Jenkins Pipeline Pipeline Syntax Using Jenkinsfile "

The get methods like getAge() , getName() , getRoll() are set as public, these methods are used to access these variables. The setter methods like setName(), setAge(), setRoll() are also declared as public and are used to set the values of the variables. Uses And Advantages Of Data Abstraction:    Data Hiding: The user will have no information about the private data variables.     Increased Flexibility     Use in Big e-Commerce websites.

This condition can be understand as if-then statements so there’s if condition then it will choose some vertex else other. The solution choosen after particular condition is called decision. This algorithm can be used for both regression and classification. In this trees internal nodes represents conditions and the leaf node depicts decision. But why they are so popular?: First off, Lets look which module allow you to make decision tree: 1234567From sklearn. tree import DecisionTreeClassifier classifier= DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=0) #for classificationclassifier= DecisionTreeRegressor(criterion='entropy', random_state=0) #for regression1.

Less preprocessing is required when compared to other algorithms. Less effort in preprocessing makes it much handy. 3. This algorithm can handle missing values and it works healthy while working with outliers. 4. The usage is simple hence its very understandable. It looks like if-else statements 5. They can be stacked with other algorithms and can reach excellent results 6. They dont require setting of lots of parameters and can easily handle multidimensional data. Thats it!

SIGINT 2 – sent to a process by its controlling terminal when a user interrupts the process by pressing [Ctrl+C]. SIGQUIT 3 – sent to a process if the user sends a quit signal [Ctrl+D]. SIGKILL 9 – this signal immediately terminates (kills) a process and the process will not perform any clean-up operations. SIGTERM 15 – this a program termination signal (kill will send this by default).

    "title": "How to synchronize remote and local directories using rsync.",
    "body": "2021/10/01 - What is Rsync?Rsync stands for “remote sync” which is a remote and local file synchronization tool. It is based on an algorithm that minimizes the amount of data copied/synced by only moving the particular files that have changed. Rsync is a very flexible network-enabled syncing tool. Due to its ubiquity on Linux and Unix-like systems and its popularity as a tool for system scripts, it is included on most Linux distributions by default. Basic Syntax?: The basic syntax of rsync is similar to scp , ssh and cp. Syncing Local Systems?: To sync files on the same system the below command can be used: 12345$rsync -r &lt;dir_name&gt;/ &lt;dir_name&gt;eg. If we want to synchronize Dir1 to Dir2 recursively the command would go as follows: 123$rsync -r Dir1/ Dir2r stands for recursively. Instead of using -r we can use the -a flag which is most commonly used. The -a option is kind of a combination flag. It stands for “archive” and syncs recursively and preserves symbolic links, special and device files, modification times, group, owner, and permissions. Syntax: 12345$rsync -a &lt;dir_name&gt;/ &lt;dir_name&gt;Example: 12345$rsync -a Dir1/ Dir2Note: The trailing / in Dir1 is required to place all the contents inside Dir1 to Dir2 if / is not provided Dir1 will be placed in Dir2 and hierarchy will be as $~/Dir2/Dir1/files For Verbose details of what is being synced ?: To know more about what files are being synced from a directory to another we can pass ‘v’ flags which means verbose as follows: 12345$rsync -av &lt;dir_name&gt;/ &lt;dir_name&gt;Syncing files to remote systems ?: Rsync can be used to transfer files and synchronize one linux server to another the only prerequisite is to have ssh access to the systems and also rsync needs to be installed on both the systems. Once SSH access verified between the two machines rsync can be performed from one system to another. Example 1 Rsync From Local to remote host:: 1234567$rsync -a ~/dir1 username@remote_host:destination_directoryExample 2 Rsync From Remote to local host:: 1234567$rsync -a username@remote_host:/home/username/dir1 place_to_sync_on_local_machineLike cp and similar tools, the source is always the first argument, and the destination is always the second. ConclusionRsync makes it a good option for many different file-level operations. Rsync can simplify file transfers over networks and add robustness to local directory syncing.

If you are, a string is how you´re going to store text, like your name, a product description or anything else text related. Here´s how template strings work in a very simple way: 1. Boosting your code with template strings: Example: 12345678910111213function killRoach (mop){ return `I killed the roach with ${mop}. ` }; killRoach( my mop ); // Output: I killed the roach with the mop.

In Python, backslash is used to signify special characters, but when we use it in a path name we want to refer to actual backslashes, not to special characters. To solve this issue, you need to add an r before the path name, so that Python can interpret backslashes as strings. Example: 123df = pd. read_csv(r'C:\Documents\File. csv')"

    "body": "2020/11/04 - AbstractionAbstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. Focus is set on the purpose of the object and not it’s functionality. CLasses: A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is an abstract class in Java. It can have Abstract methods(no body) and Non-abstract methods(has a body). An abstract class can not be initiated, meaning we can`t create an onject of its type. Let’s see why do we need abstract classes. Let’s say that we hava a class Aimal that has a lot of subclasses(Dog, Cat, etc. ) We don`t want to hava an Animal object becouse we only model a certain animals. Here is an example: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435abstract class Animal{ //abstract methods public abstract void sound(); //no body }public class Dog extends Animal{ @Override //impleenting the abstract method public void sound(){ System. out. println( Woof! ) }public static void main(String args[]) { Animal obj = new Dog(); obj. sound(); }}When to use abstract classes:    An abstract class is a good choice if we are using the inheritance concept since it provides a common base class implementation to derived classes.     An abstract class is good to use if we want to declare non-public members. In an interface, all methods must be public.     If we want to add new methods in the future, then an abstract class is a better choice. Because if we add new methods to an interface, then all of the classes that already implemented that interface will have to be changed to implement the new methods.     If we want to create multiple versions of our component, create an abstract class. Abstract classes provide a simple and easy way to version our components. By updating the base class, all inheriting classes are automatically updated with the change. Interfaces, on the other hand, cannot be changed once created. If a new version of an interface is required, we must create a whole new interface.     If we want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of our component, use an abstract class. Abstract classes allow us to partially implement our class, whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members.  "

A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key. A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value. The Map interface includes methods for basic operations (such as put(), get(), remove(), containsKey(), containsValue(), size(), and empty()), bulk operations (such as putAll() and clear()), and collection views (such as keySet(), entrySet(), and values()). A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key. The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap. Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. This is Map Interface(‘java. util.

You want to add support for mutiple languages so that people from across the world can use your application. But there is one small problem you only know 3-4 languages :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Do not worry Locale and ResourceBundle have come to your rescue. These two classes are available under java. util package. Locale: Locale class will be used to store information about language as per ISO language codes. Now what is this? Each Locale is defined usign two things:    language code     country code  In ISO format two letters are used for describing language code (small) as well as country code (capitalized). For example: English and Indian locale would be en IN, similarly Portuguese and Brazil locale would be pt BR. In code a Locale object will be instantiated like this: Locale localeObj = new Locale(language,country); where language could be String containing “en” or “pt” or any other language code. Similarly, country String could hold “IN” or “BR” or any other country code. Properties Files: It’s fancy name for a file that stores key-value pairs. Basically we will use this file to store all the strings that we display in our application. Now, you can see how this will function. We will use same keys but change values for supporting different laguages and store it in a new properties file MessageBundle_&lt;lannguage code&gt;_&lt;country code&gt;. properties. There will be one default properties file which will contain original strings that you have used in application. This properties files will be named as MessageBundle. properties. Let’s assume that the application was written in Portuguese and now we want to add support for English then we will have to create a MessageBundle_en_IN. properties file. You can see what the contents may look like.  ResourceBundle: This class provides functionality to read properties files. But as you can see there can be many such files. Thus, it requires Locale object and  path/to/MessageBundle  to narrow down on which file to use. In code an object will be instantiated like this: Resource messageObj = ResourceBundle( MessageBundle , localeObj); We read values from properies files using getString() function by passing key as argument as shown, String str = messageObj. getString( Norte ) where Norte is a key in properties file.

The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. why Python?: I find Python to be very simple and its syntax is very close to english. What is the problem?: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, … By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. How do we approach this problem?:    The first step in solving any problem, is to understand the problem first, make sure you can communicate the problem to someone else in your own way without losing the focus.     Write down the problem in pseudocode, this is more like english, so for example you might start this problem’s pseudocode like this          Create the fibonnaci sequence with terms up to but not including four million,           Check if each term is a even number,           Add all the numbers that fulfils (2) and print the sum       Create an algorithm to implement in your code: This would be a step by step process on how you intend to write the code that solves the problem. Let us write and algorithm for our problem:  Create the function for the fibonnaci series,this function returns: 12345  return 1 for the first term  return 1 for the second term  for terms after the second return their value as the sum of the two values before them   Initiate the a variable ‘sum’ to hold the summation of the even fibonnaci numbers     Initiate a varible ‘n’ to indicate the number of a corresponding term in the fibonnaci series     Check if the value of the term is less than 4000000, if true,     Check if the fibonacci term is even, if true     Add the value to the variable ‘sum’     If the number is less than four million, Increament ‘n’ and repeat steps 1 through 6 untill a term that is equal or greater than four million is reached.  Note: I don’t always go through this process religiously, so don’t worry yourself, look at the problem and do whatever works for you. Just make sure you solve the problem. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455#Create the function for the fibonnaci series#Name the functiondef fibonacci(n):  #the first term of the fibonnaci series is 1  if n == 1:    return 1  #the second term of the fibonnaci series is 1  elif n == 2:    return 1  #for terms after the second their value is the sum of the two values before them  elif n &gt; 2:    return fibonacci(n-1)+ fibonacci(n-2)#initiate the sum variablesum = 0#initiate the position variable of termsn = 1#Check if the value of the term is less than 4000000while fibonacci(n) &lt;= 4000000:  #Check if the fibonacci term is even  if fibonacci(n)%2==0:    #if that is true add it to the sum    sum = sum + fibonacci(n)  #increament the position varible to move to the next term  n += 1#print the sum variale which by now contains the sum of all even fibonacci terms below 4000000print(sum)Optimization using Cache: While the code above will solve the problem, you’ll notice that your system will slow down and it might take a while before you get the solution. This is due to the fact that the fibonnaci series is a recursion problem…like a Russian doll, in which one doll (fibonnaci term) is dependent on the another term. Example: fibonnnaci(5) = fibonacci(4) + (fibonnaci 3) fibonnacci(4) = fibonnacci(3) + fibonnaci(2) fibonnaci(3) = fibonnaci(2) + fibonnaci(1) Hence; fibonnaci(5) = fibonnaci(2) + fibonnaci (2) + fibbonaci(1) + fibonnaci(2) + fibonnaci(1) You’ll notice that no matter how big the term is, you have to break it down to fibonnaci(2) and fibonnaci(1) this is recursion and this process is slow. Luckily, Pythonb has a solution that can help, which is by using memoization, so if you asked fibonnaci(5), python won’t recalculate fibonnaci(4) since it knows the value from previous calcualtions in the series. The module for this is the lru_cache. This will make the program run faster. let’s implement this: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667#import lru_cache to prevent your system from slowing down due to recurssion of the fibonnaci seriesfrom functools import lru_cache#specify the maxsize of the cache@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)#Create the function for the fibonnaci series#Name the functiondef fibonacci(n):  #the first term of the fibonnaci series is 1  if n == 1:    return 1  #the second term of the fibonnaci series is 1  elif n == 2:    return 1  #for terms after the second their value is the sum of the two values before them  elif n &gt; 2:    return fibonacci(n-1)+ fibonacci(n-2)#initiate the sum variablesum = 0#initiate the position variable of termsn = 1#Check if the value of the term is less than 4000000while fibonacci(n) &lt;= 4000000:  #Check if the fibonacci term is even  if fibonacci(n)%2==0:    #if that is true add it to the sum    sum = sum + fibonacci(n)  #increament the position varible to move to the next term  n += 1#print the sum variale which by now contains the sum of all even fibonacci terms below 4000000print(sum)Conclusion:: So this was a 1-minute (maybe more) read article on using Python to solve Project Euler’s Problem 2 and I also try to show the need for optimisation by using cache. There is no one way to solve this problem, you can choose to use a diffrent approach, it depends on you.  I hope this article helps you to get started with using python to solve problems, you can try the more difficult ones, I should be adding another article on another problem soon. Thank you!! "

Write down the problem in pseudocode, this is more like english, so for example you might start this problem’s pseudocode like this          Pick all numbers that falls below 1000,           Check if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5,           Add all numbers that fulfil (2) and print the sum.       Create an algorithm to implement in your code: This would be a step by step process on how you intend to write the code that solves the problem. Let us write and algorithm for our problem:    initiate a variable ‘count’ that will hold the sum of the numbers.     Use the range function to go through all numbers below 1000(Exclusive)     Check if the number is a multiple of 3 using the ‘%’ operator and increment the variable ‘count’ if this condition is true.     Check if the number is a multiple of 5 using the ‘%’ operator and increment the variable ‘count’ if this condition is true.     print the count variable which by now contains the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 out.  Note: I don’t always go through this process religiously, so don’t worry yourself, look at the problem and do whatever works for you. Just make sure you solve the problem. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425#initiate the count variablecount = 0#Use the range function to go through all numbers below 1000(Exclusive)for i in range(1,1000):  #Check if the number is a multiple of 3 using the '%' operator  if i%3==0:    count += i  #Check if the number is a multiple of 5 using the '%' operator  elif i%5==0:    count += i#print the count variable which by now contains the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 outprint (count)Conclusion:: So this was a 1-minute read article on using Python to solve Project Euler’s Problem 1. There is no one way to solve this problem, you can choose to use list comprehension and list. sum method, it depends on you.  I hope this article helps you to get started with using python to solve problems, you can try the more difficult ones, I should be adding another article on another problem soon. Thank you!! "

    "title": "SQL and its commands",
    "body": "2020/10/29 - SQL and its commandsLet us first learn about what is SQL SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It lets us access and manipulate databases. What Can SQL do?:    SQL can execute queries against a database     SQL can retrieve data from a database     SQL can insert records in a database     SQL can update records in a database     SQL can delete records from a database     SQL can create new databases     SQL can create new tables in a database     SQL can create stored procedures in a database     SQL can create views in a database     SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views  SO, Structured Query Language(SQL) as we all know is the database language by the use of which we can perform certain operations on the existing database, and also we can use this language to create a database. SQL uses certain commands like Create, Drop, Insert, etc. to carry out the required tasks. These SQL commands are mainly categorized into five categories as:    DDL – Data Definition Language     DQL – Data Query Language     DML – Data Manipulation Language     DCL – Data Control Language     TCL – Transaction Control Language.  Now I will explain the above types of commands: DDL(Data Definition Language):: It actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database. Examples of DDL commands::  CREATE – is used to create the database or its objects (like a table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers). Syntax : 123456789101112131415CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype,column datatype,column3 datatype, . . . . ); DROP – is used to delete objects from the database. Syntax: 123DROP TABLE table_name; ALTER-is used to alter the structure of the database. Syntax: 1234567ALTER TABLE table_nameADD column_name datatype; TRUNCATE–is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed. Syntax: 123TRUNCATE TABLE table_name; COMMENT –is used to add comments to the data dictionary. Syntax: 12345--Select all:(Single line comment)/*Select all the column of all the records in the Customers table:*/(multi-line comment) RENAME –is used to rename an object existing in the database. Syntax: 12345ALTER TABLE table_nameRENAME TO new_table_name;DQL (Data Query Language) :: DML statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. Example of DQL::  SELECT – is used to retrieve data from a database. Syntax: 1234567SELECT column1, column2, . . . FROM table_name;DML(Data Manipulation Language):: The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. Examples of DML::  INSERT – is used to insert data into a table. Syntax: 12345INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, . . . )VALUES (value1, value2, value3, . . . ); UPDATE – is used to update existing data within a table. Syntax: 1234567UPDATE table_nameSET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, . . . WHERE condition; DELETE – is used to delete records from a database table. Syntax: 123DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;DCL(Data Control Language):: DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deals with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. Examples of DCL commands::  GRANT-gives user’s access privileges to the database. Syntax: 12345GRANT privilege_name ON object_name TO {user_name | PUBLIC | role_name}  REVOKE-withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command. Syntax: 12345REVOKE privilege_name ON object_name FROM {User_name | PUBLIC | Role_name}TCL(transaction Control Language):: TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database. Examples of TCL commands::  COMMIT– commits a Transaction. Syntax: 123COMMIT; ROLLBACK– rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs. Syntax: 123ROLLBACK; SAVEPOINT–sets a savepoint within a transaction. Syntax: 123SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME; SET TRANSACTION–specify characteristics for the transaction. Syntax: 123SET TRANSACTION [ READ-WRITE | READ ONLY ];This was just an introduction to SQL and its commands. Hope you understand what is SQL from this article. Thank You!! "

    "title": "Understading Datatypes, Variables Constants In GO",
    "body": "2020/10/28 - Understading Datatypes, Variables Constants In GO 1. Data Types:: Data Types represent the type of the value stored in a variable, type of the value a function returns, etc. There are three basic types in Go Language: Numeric types - Represent numeric values which includes integer, floating point, and complex values. Various numeric types are: int8 - 8 bit signed integers. int16 - 16 bit signed integers. int32 - 32 bit signed integers. int64 - 64 bit signed integers. uint8 - 8 bit unsigned integers. uint16 - 16 bit unsigned integers. uint32 - 32 bit unsigned integers. uint64 - 64 bit unsigned integers. float32 - 32 bit floating point numbers. float64 - 64 bit floating point numbers. complex64 – has float32 real and imaginary parts. complex128 - has float32 real and imaginary parts.  String types - Represents a sequence of bytes(characters). You can do various operations on strings like string concatenation, extracting substring, etc  Boolean types - Represents 2 values, either true or false.  2. Variables:: Variables point to a memory location which stores some kind of value. The type parameter(in the below syntax) represents the type of value that can be stored in the memory location. Variable can be declared using the syntax- 123var &lt;variable_name&gt; &lt;type&gt;Once You declare a variable of a type You can assign the variable to any value of that type. You can also give an initial value to a variable during the declaration itself using 123var &lt;variable_name&gt; &lt;type&gt; = &lt;value&gt;If You declare the variable with an initial value, Go an infer the type of the variable from the type of value assigned. So You can omit the type during the declaration using the syntax- 123  var &lt;variable_name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;Also, You can declare multiple variables with the syntax- 123  var &lt;variable_name1&gt;, &lt;variable_name2&gt; = &lt;value1&gt;, &lt;value2&gt;The below program in this Go tutorial has some Golang examples of variable declarations- 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647package mainimport  fmt func main() {  //declaring a integer variable x  var x int  x=3 //assigning x the value 3   fmt. Println( x: , x) //prints 3    //declaring a integer variable y with value 20 in a single statement and prints it  var y int=20  fmt. Println( y: , y)    //declaring a variable z with value 50 and prints it  //Here type int is not explicitly mentioned   var z=50  fmt. Println( z: , z)    //Multiple variables are assigned in single line- i with an integer and j with a string  var i, j = 100, hello   fmt. Println( i and j: , i,j)}The output will be 123456789x: 3y: 20z: 50i and j: 100 hello Go Language also provides an easy way of declaring the variables with value by omitting the var keyword using 1&lt;variable_name&gt; := &lt;value&gt;Note: You used := instead of =. You cannot use := just to assign a value to a variable which is already declared. := is used to declare and assign value.  Create a file called assign. go with the following code- 1234567891011121314151617181920212223package mainimport ( fmt )func main() {	a := 20	fmt. Println(a)	//gives error since a is already declared	a := 30	fmt. Println(a)}Execute go run assign. go to see the result as- 123. /assign. go:7:4: no new variables on left side of :=	Note: Variables declared without an initial value will have of 0 for numeric types, false for Boolean and empty string for strings.  3. Constants:: Constant variables are those variables whose value cannot be changed once assigned. A constant in Go programming language is declared by using the keyword “const”. Create a file called constant. go and with the following code- 12345678910111213141516171819package mainimport ( fmt )func main() {	const b =10	fmt. Println(b)	b = 30	fmt. Println(b)}Execute go run constant. go to see the result as- 123Execute go run constant. go to see the result as-  That’s all for today! Happy Coding :) "

Refreshing browser after a specific time:: 123&lt;meta http-equiv=”refresh” content=”10 /&gt; Using this meta code you can refresh your webpage in the iterval of every 10 seconds. Isn’t that super cool? You can use it to make your browser refresh every 5 seconds while you do your CSS. You don’t have to refresh your browser manually to see the changes. Note: you can set content value to any value you like and it will increase or decrease the seconds based on the given value.  4. Hiding elements without the help of CSS:: 123&lt;h1 hidden&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;Oh yess! Its true you can hide html elements without the help of CSS by using ‘hidden’ attribute. Also it doesn’t work like CSS hidden and what I mean by that is when we hide any element using attribute ‘hidden’ it works more like CSS “display: none” rather than “visibility: hidden”. It takes no space while CSS “visibility: hidden” only hides the element but still take up the space.  5. HTML prefetch webpage:: 123&lt;link rel=”prefetch prerender” href=”” /&gt;We know that after landing to the homepage the user is more likely to navigate to about page then you can prefetch the CSS files that will necessary for that webpage in the background before user even clicks on the link to navigate to that page. What it does is speeds up the process and user feels little to no delay in a reloading of a webpage.  Happy Coding and Keep Reading, Cheers! "

    "title": "Common gotchas when mutating a slice",
    "body": "2020/10/28 - Common gotchas when mutating a sliceMutating slices in Go can be a bit confusing. It’s generally known that slices are a reference an underlying array. But when it comes to mutating a slice, there are some very common gotchas that can trip you up. Let’s look at three scenarios. From inside a function: In Go, all variables are passed by value, meaning the function body will receive a copy. When you pass a slice to a function, the variable (slice descriptor), is a copy of the caller’s reference to the underlying array (by caller I mean the place where the function is being called). So if you try to append to the slice inside the function, you are actually appending to a duplicate of the original reference. The caller’s slice will remain unaffected. In the example below, we try to append a value to a slice, using the addNum function. Unfortunately, after calling addNum, the slice hasn’t changed. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425// THIS WON'T WORKmySlice := []int{1,2,3}func addNum (s []int, num int) {	s = append(s, num)}addNum(mySlice, 4)fmt. Println(mySlice)// --&gt; [1 2 3]To successfully append to the slice, the function must return its copy of the slice. You then assign it to the original slice. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223mySlice := []int{1,2,3}func addNum (s []int, num int) []int {	return append(s, num)}mySlice = addNum(mySlice, 4)fmt. Println(mySlice)// --&gt; [1 2 3 4]From inside a for-loop: When ranging over a slice, the variable referencing each value points to a copy of the value. If you try to mutate the value at a given index with this variable, it will not work. Once you leave the scope of the for-loop, you’ll find the slice was unaffected. 123456789101112131415161718192021// THIS WON'T WORKsomePeople := []string{ Ada ,  Grace ,  Charles }for _, name := range somePeople {	name = strings. ToUpper(name)}fmt. Println(somePeople)// --&gt; [ Ada   Grace   Charles ]For the mutation to stick, you must use bracket notation instead: 12345678910111213141516171819somePeople := []string{ Ada ,  Grace ,  Charles }for i, name := range somePeople {	somePeople[i] = strings. ToUpper(name)}fmt. Println(somePeople)// --&gt; [ ADA   GRACE   CHARLES ]When using variables: This is similar to the for-loop example. Any changes to a slice require the use of bracket notation. Variables will point to copies of the value at a given index, meaning any changes to that variable will not affect the slice. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435// THIS WON'T WORKtype food struct {	name  string}pantry := []food{	{name:  banana },	{name:  satsuma },	{name:  kiwi },}toChange := pantry[2] // this makes a copy!toChange = food{name:  strawberry }fmt.

    "body": "2020/10/28 - NumPy in PythonLet us first learn what is NumPy: NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy is an open-source project and we can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. why should we use NumPy?: In Python, we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50 times faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray. It provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Where is NumPy used?: Python NumPy arrays provide tools for integrating C, C++, etc. It is also useful in linear algebra, random number capability, etc. NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data. Why is NumPy Faster than lists?: NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. now let us learn how to create an array using NumPy: Create a NumPy ndarray Object: NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray. We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function. 1234567891011121314151617import numpy as nparr = np. array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])print(arr)print(type(arr))OUTPUT: [1 2 3 4 5] &lt;class ‘numpy. ndarray’&gt; Joining NumPy Arrays: Joining means putting contents of two or more arrays in a single array. In SQL we join tables based on a key, whereas in NumPy we join arrays by axes. We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the concatenate() function, along with the axis. If the axis is not explicitly passed, it is taken as 0. 123456789101112131415161718192021import numpy as nparr1 = np. array([1, 2, 3])arr2 = np. array([4, 5, 6])arr = np. concatenate((arr1, arr2))print(arr)OUTPUT: [1 2 3 4 5 6] Splitting NumPy Arrays: Splitting is the reverse operation of Joining. Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple. We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits. Split the array into 3 parts: 1234567891011121314151617import numpy as nparr = np. array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])newarr = np. array_split(arr, 3)print(newarr)OUTPUT: [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4]), array([5, 6])] Sorting Arrays: Sorting means putting elements in an ordered sequence. Ordered sequence is any sequence that has an order corresponding to elements, like numeric or alphabetical, ascending, or descending. The NumPy ndarray object has a function called sort(), that will sort a specified array. Sort the array: 1234567891011import numpy as nparr = np. array([3, 2, 0, 1])print(np. sort(arr))OUTPUT: [0 1 2 3] conclusion:: so this was a 1-minute read article on NumPy.

    "title": "Persistent Data Structures",
    "body": "2020/10/28 - Persistent Data StructuresPersistent data structures are data structures that preserve the previous versions of the structure on modification. They are effectively immutable, and depending on the implementation offer a special kind of memory optimization. Being immutable, the persistent data structures are useful when writing concurrent code and the need arises to use some kind of data structure like list, tree, map or other. When a persistent structure is modified, the original structure remains unchanged (it is a previous version), and the modification method returns a new structure that contains the modification. Consider the following list: 123a: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3if we add another element to it, the list itself is modified: 12345a := add(a, 4)a: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4However if we use a persistent list, then the same operation would look like this: 1234567891011121314151617a: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3b := persistent_list_add(a, 4)print(a)1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3print(b)1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4The method that adds an element to the list, actually returns a new list, containing the element we added. The original list remains unchanged. There are multiple ways that this can be achieved:  Doing copy-on-write - we copy the entire list in b then actually add the element, leaving the original list a unchanged. This however is not very memory efficient, as every modification would allocate memory for all previous elements - O(n^2) space complexity.  Using a linked list, but we only keep the pointer to the head and the tail of the list. This way we can share the unmodified elements andoptimize the memory usage. Let’s consider the second way of implementing this data structure. We want to reuse the elements from a and just add the final element. 1234567891011a: head a      tail a  \          |  +-&gt; (1) -&gt; (2) -&gt; (3)  /          \b: head b        +-&gt; (4) tail ba and b share the first 3 elements, but only b can “see” the final added element. When removing or updating an element, then we’re only copying the list up to the affected elements. Let’s say we want to update the second element. Then we have to copy the head and the second element: 12345678910111213141516171819a: head a      tail a  \          |  +-&gt; (1) -&gt; (2) -&gt; (3)  /        /  \b: head b     /   +-&gt; (4) tail b and c         /  (1) -&gt; (7) -+   |c: head cAfter changing the element 2 to 7, we have to copy all affected elements, but the rest of the list remains unchanged and shared between the previous versions. Note that all changes return new versions of the list and we cannot directly modify previous versions - a and b remain unchanged after we do set(b, 2, 7). An example of persistent list in Python: Let’s implement this kind of structure in Python. Every list would contain nodes that hold the data and point to the next node. The list itself will contain the HEAD and TAIL nodes. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214215216217218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232233234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255class Node:  def __init__(self, value):    self. value = value    self. next = None    def __repr__(self):    return str(self. value)class PList:  def __init__(self, head=None, tail=None):    self. head = head    self. tail = tail    def add(self, value):    '''Adds to the end of the list.

    "title": "Useful Python libraries For Natural Processing",
    "body": "2020/10/28 - Useful Python libraries For Natural Processing1. CoreNLP: The CoreNLP library — a product of Stanford University — was built to be a production-ready natural language processing solution, capable of delivering NLP predictions and analyses at scale. CoreNLP is written in Java, but multiple Python packages and APIs are available for it, including a native Python NLP library called StanfordNLP. CoreNLP includes a broad range of language tools—grammar tagging, named entity recognition, parsing, sentiment analysis, and plenty more. It was designed to be human language agnostic, and currently supports Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish in addition to English (with Russian, Swedish, and Danish support available from third parties). CoreNLP also includes a web API server, a convenient way to serve predictions without too much additional work. 2. Genism: Gensim does just two things, but does them exceedingly well. Its focus is statistical semantics—analyzing documents for their structure, then scoring other documents based on their similarity. Gensim can work with very large bodies of text by streaming documents to its analysis engine and performing unsupervised learning on them incrementally. It can create multiple types of models, each suited to different scenarios: Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, FastText, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.  3. NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK for short, is among the best-known and most powerful of the Python natural language processing libraries. Many corpora (data sets) and trained models are available to use with NLTK out of the box, so you can start experimenting with NLTK right away.  As the documentation states, NLTK provides a wide variety of tools for working with text: “classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. ” It can also work with some third-party tools to enhance its functionality. 4. Pattern: If all you need to do is scrape a popular website and analyze what you find, reach for Pattern. This natural language processing library is far smaller and narrower than other libraries covered here, but that also means it’s focused on doing one common job really well. Pattern comes with built-ins for scraping a number of popular web services and sources (Google, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, generic RSS, etc. ), all of which are available as Python modules (e. g. , from pattern. web import Twitter). You don’t have to reinvent the wheels for getting data from those sites, with all of their individual quirks. You can then perform a variety of common NLP operations on the data, such as sentiment analysis. 5. PyNLPI: PyNLPI (pronounced “pineapple”) has only a basic roster of natural language processing functions, but it has some truly useful data-conversion and data-processsing features for NLP data formats. Most of the NLP functions in PyNLPI are for basic jobs like tokenization or n-gram extraction, along with some statistical functions useful in NLP like Levenshtein distance between strings or Markov chains. Those functions are implemented in pure Python for convenience, so they’re unlikely to have production-level performance.  Thanks for reading, cheers! "

The launch of Java SE 7 was an affirmation of Oracle’s commitment to the language and technology. It was a big achievement for the tech giant’s two-year ownership of Sun Microsystems – the company that created Java programming language. The Java 7 release was solid which offers some major upgrades including major bug fixes and improved support for non-Java dynamic languages, plus type interference support for generic class creation. Main features of Java 7 include::    Language enhancements grouped under a Project Coin     String object in a switch statement     Multiple exceptions handling to eliminate duplication of codes     Upgraded class-loader architecture     Improved type interference for generic instance     Library support for ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) algorithms     Upgraded Rowset 1. 1 and JDBC 4. 1     Improved Managed Beans     Automatic resource management in try-statement     Concurrency and collections updates     Compressed 64-bit pointers     JVM support for dynamically-typed languages  What is Java 8 and its features?: Java SE 8 (codename “Spider”) is a revolutionary release of the development platform which brings some major tweaks and upgrades to the Java programming language including an enhanced JavaScript engine, new APIs for a date, and time manipulation, improved and faster JVM, and more. Java SE 8 is a giant leap forward for the programming language which also brings the tech giant’s most anticipated upgrade – the lambda expressions. It’s a new language feature exclusively added in the Java 8 update and which is touted as one of the most significant upgrades to the programming language. The lambda expressions are by far the biggest update to the model which is likely to increase productivity in many business models. Major features of Java 8 include::    Language-level support for Lambda Expressions     Interface Default and Static Methods     Unsigned Integer Arithmetic     Concurrent API enhancements     New Date and Time API     Parallel Sorting     Null Reference Template     New JavaScript Engine, Nashorn     New and improved Stream API     Removal of permanent generation  So in short the difference between Java 7 and Java 8 is as follows::    Java SE 7 was code-named Dolphin and the code name for Java SE 8 is Spider.     Java 7 is supported on Win XP whereas Java 8 is not officially supported on Win XP.     Java 7 brings JVM support for dynamically-typed languages plus Type Interference for Generic Instance creation.  Java 8 brings the most anticipated feature for the programming language called Lambda Expressions, a new language feature that allows users to code local functions as method arguments.  Users can catch multiple exception types in one catch block which could be impossible before JDK 7. Java 8 brings its new specialized API for Date and Time manipulation. Conclusion:: Java 7 was a significant upgrade to the Java model which accommodates some major upgrades to the programming language including language enhancements, multiple exceptions handling, JVM support for dynamically-typed languages, and more. With Java 8, the programming language brings along its anticipated feature called the Lambda Expressions which changed the entire coding paradigm for the Java platform. Thank You!! "

My name is Ronald, I am a FullStack developer that means I take care of both sides: the back and the front side. With JavaScript I can manage the front through native Javascript or through Frameworks such as React. js, Vue. js, or Angular. Of course you need to know HTML and CSS, two basic and easy languages ​​to learn before mastering JavaScript. On the back side I use Node. js (especially the framework: Express) to manage the server and the API’s, I also like to use MongoDB as a database since the language is also Javascript. If you need more tools such as a Docker container or a cloud deployment with AWS and monitoring on production with PM2, you would still be comfortable since the language is still similar to working with JavaScript. Another advantage of Javascript is that it is a language that is relatively easy to learn, with which you can learn to master the front and the back in a few years. Something that with other back-end languages ​​like Java would take a little longer. In conclusion, if you are looking for a programming language with which to comfortably handle the entire fabric of an application, JavaScript is surely a very good choice. :+1: "

Problem:: JavaScript’s model is based on garbage collection pattern. This means that the developer don’t have dirrect control over allocated memory. Memory locations (variables) marked as null will be collected by garbage collector and removed from memory. But when garbage collector needs to dispose a lot of objects, takes a lot of processing time. Neceserry spent processing time is bad for the performance of the game. In most cases the memory profile will be like this: How to fix that: Solution for this kind of problem is implementing Object pools pattern.

Python offers a number of ways to create dynamic text and the coolest one is called f-strings The not-so-cool way: Python during its creation had influences from other languages (like C), so it inherited the parser mechanism that runs through a string looking for specific symbols (like %d, %s, %f, for integers, strings and floats respectively). Fortunately in python it is simpler, there is only one symbol for all types of variables, but even so it is not as cool as f-strings 12345678910111213name =  Lebron James age = 35height = 2. 06print( Hey people!

    "body": "2020/10/27 - Writing files in Python: Working with data, it is often useful not just to read files, but also to be able to write data to files. Here we are going to discuss a first simple approach on how to write data, that we have saved in lists to a file. Create the data: Imagine, that you have read data from a file and calculated some new stuff, that you have saved in two lists: 12345x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]y = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]Now we want to write these to lists to a file, so we can forget about them for a few weeks and then use a read-function and continue working again. A file we are interested in might look something like this: 1234567891011121314151617x,y1,72,63,54,45,36,27,1Write code that creates a file: The easiest code to create and write a file looks like this: 123456789with open( testfile. dat ,  w ) as file:  file. write( x,y\n )  for i in range(len(x)):    file. write(str(x[i]) +  ,  + str(y[i]) +  \n )The first line opens a file named “testfile. dat”. The “w”-statement opens a file and overwrites content. If we swap it for “a” the new content will be appended to the file. Try that one out to see the difference! The first write statement just creates a nice heading for our file, while the rest of the file is written in a loop and adds the data. The single entries have to be given as strings, so the float (or whatever) has to be converted. If you are not sure about the different outcome of 123str(x[i])and 123 x[i] try both out so it does not go wrong in an important moment. Different to reading a file in Python it is not super easy to write a function to write data to a file that fits all needs. But try out some different options to save your data in the python-program and you will find an option that suits your needs. And the general structure usually does not change, so you will be able to go a long way with the few lines you learned here! "

    "body": "2020/10/27 - Reading files in Python: When working with data, it is usually provided as a simple text-file, a . dat-file or something similar. Reading a file so we can use the data in our program follows few, simple steps. Nevertheless a lot of things one finds online may seem really complicated, so we start with a really simple example, that can be modified easily. Writing the datafile “test. dat”: The file we are going to read should be named “test. dat” and saved in the same folder as this small program. Doing so you should be able to simply copy and paste the code snippets. The file should look like this: 123456789101112131415x,y1,12,23,34,45,56,6Writing a function read_file: As you usually do not just read one file, we are going to write a function that takes the name of the file and returns lists with the data. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627def get_data(name):           # first stept of writing a function  with open(name) as file:      # opens the file we want to read    data = file. read()       # reads the file  lines = data. split( \n )      # split into lines after each linebreak  del lines[0]            # the first line is  x, y   del lines[-1]            # the last line is empty  x = list()  y = list()             # create empty lists  for line in lines:    entry = line. split( , )     # split each line at the comma    x. append(float(entry[0]))    y. append(float(entry[1]))    # add data to list  return x, y             # ending of the functionThis is a big bunch of code, but there are only a few important things to notice: First of all the file is split with “\n” which corresponds to the linebreak. After that two lines are deleted. Try out what happens if you do not do that step! After that the lines are split at each “,”. If you have different things where you want to split that is no problem, for example 123entry = data. split( \t )splits the lines at a tab. The return statement ends the written function and gives us the two lists that we have created. Using the written function: Now we can use the written function to read the file that we have created in the beginning. To do so, simply add some code to your Python-file: 1234567x, y = get_data( test. dat ) # calls the function with our fileprint(x)print(y)By giving the function a filename we can now read that file and use a print-statement to check if everything worked as expected. Modify this function: If you take a close look at the function, you will notice that you can modify it for different use. By adding more lists you can work with files with more entries and as we said before, we can change the characters Python uses to split a line to many different things. "

Now, Bootstrap is an open and free HTML, CSS, and JS toolkit that is used by web developers to create responsive website designs quickly and effectively. When a Bootstrap web developer connects these files to the page, a large number of classes and ready-made components will become available for design layout. Bootstrap classes: Bootstrap classes can be divided into:    Classes for creating a grid(adaptive page layout).     Classes for styling content(text,code ,images,tables and other information) .     Service classes (for solving the most common auxiliary problems, such as alignment, display control, adding borders, etc. ).  Benefits of Bootstrap: Bootstrap is beneficial for the creation of layouts by providing a great number of templates and ready-made solutions. Other benefits are:  Cross-browser and adaptability:Sites created using Bootstrap are identically displayed on different devices and in modern browsers.  Ease of use:Working with Bootstrap is not difficult; it only requires basic skills and having some basic knowledge working with layouts.  Easy to learn:Again, it is easy to learn. A considerable number of tutorial videos will help you understand Bootstrap without any difficulties and master it. Disadvantages of Bootstrap: Bootstrap has several disadvantages as well.  TemplatesSites developed with Bootstrap are similar to each other: the same structure, navigation, buttons. Each new site is similar to the many already created ones, and this does not seem professional so trying not to use ready-made solutions will help create unique websites. That being said, it is important to understand all the tools offered by Bootstrap to maximize their use in development.  Lack of flexibilityDespite all the advantages, Bootstrap is a tool that has its limitations ( all sites on it are similar to each other). Therefore, Bootstrap may not be suitable for the implementation of some projects.  Older browsersSince Bootstrap tries to keep up with the times and is constantly updated and as a result, the sites on Bootstrap may not display correctly in older browsers. How to download bootstrap?: There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your web site. You can:    Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap. com     Include Bootstrap from a CDN  Conclusion:: Bootstrap has finally turned out to be the trendiest front-end design framework. The main reason for its success is the huge number of resources accessible through it. It holds a very big online community and help is easily available. It is always kept updated and is presently available on GitHub for download. Thanks!! "

    "body": "2020/10/27 - Java Final vs Finally vs FinalizeThis is a very common question which one might face in an interview. So today we are going to discuss the three keywords final, finally, and finalize which are frequently confused. First, let me tell you what a keyword is. A keyword is a reserved word which has a predefined meaning in the language. Because of this, you cannot use keywords as names for variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers. There are 51 keywords in Java. So now you know what a keyword is, let us see the differences between the keywords final, finally, and finalize. Final Keyword: Final is a keyword used to apply restriction on class, method, and variable. So, a final class cannot be inherited, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable cannot be changed. A final variable that has no value is called blank final variable or uninitialized final variable. 123final String your_name;Below is an example of a final variable 1234567891011121314151617class FinalExample{  public static void main()  {    final int a=10;    a=5; //compile Time error  }}So what is going on? a=5 shows a compile time because once a variable is declared you cannot change its value. Also, you should know that a final variable is inherited. So, you cannot declare a constructor as final because a constructor is not inherited. Finally keyword: Finally is a block used in try-catch. Each try contains one and only one finally block. It will be executed whether an exception is handled or not. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839class FinallyExample{  public static void main()  {    try    {      int a=25;      System. out. println(a);    }    catch(Exception e)    {      System. out. println(e);    }    finally    {      System. out. println( finally block is always executed );    }  }}OUTPUT: 25 finally block is always executed Finalize keyword: Finalize is a method used to perform clean up processing just before the object is garbage collected. Before the object is garbage collected, the runtime system calls its finalize() method. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435public class FinalizeExample {    public static void main(String[] args)    {      FinalizeExample obj = new FinalizeExample();      obj = null;      // calling garbage collector      System. gc();      System. out. println( end of garbage collection );     }    @Override   protected void finalize()    {      System. out. println( finalize method called );    }  } OUTPUT: end of garbage collection finalize method called So, in a nutshell the differencve between final, finally, and finalize is final is a keyword, finally is a block and finalize in a method.

The green line is the baseline, an invisble line on which elements “sit”. As you can see, some characters in the word paragraph go beyond this line, creating the red line you’re seeing. And since images are inline elements, they “sit” on the baseline relative to elements before or after them, leaving a whitespace between their base and the space created by characters going beyond the baseline. To avoid this, just give the images a display: 'block'; 1234567img {  display: block;}There, done! Now all images on your page won’t have that annoying whitespace as they will fill it up. "

It’s called localeCompare: referenceString. localeCompare(compareString) The referenceString is the string we want to compare, and the compareString is the string against which we’re compareing. The localeCompare method returns a Number, which may be:    -1 if the referenceString is sorted before the compareString    0 if the two strings are equal    1 if the referenceString is sorted after the compareString Here’s an example: 1234567891011const words = ['hello', 'répondre', 'sort', 'déclaré'];words. sort((a, b) =&gt; a. localeCompare(b)); As we can see, some words have certain punctuations.

Before this version, the interface could not have concrete methods or static methods. For create a concrate method in interface, the method must be the keyword default in the signature. Example: 12345678910111213141516171819public default void test(){ //code}public static void staticMethod(){ //code}With this, it is possible add to interface some methods without broken classes that implement it(maintaining compatibility). For example, before java 8 the interface List does not have the method “sort”. If the java programmers wanted to add behavior in the java. util. List without change your subtypes (Vector, ArrayList and others), will be not possible. If they add the behavior, your subtypes will be obligated to change your code to compile and maintain compability. To make the behavior transparent to your subtypes, now they can use the default method to add some features without obligated your subtypes change code.

It was added into Spring 4. 0 to make the development of RESTful Web Services in Spring framework easier. If you are familiar with Rest web services you know that the main difference between a web application and REST API is that the response from a web application is view in HTML + CSS + JavaScript (client/human view), While REST API returns data in form of JSON or XML(most of the REST clients are programs) From there we can see the difference between @Controller and @RestController @Controller creates a map of the model object and finds a view. @RestController returns the object and object data written onto HTTP response as JSON or XML. The traditional way is to use @Controller and use @ResponseBody annotation but since this is the default behavior of RESTful Web services, Spring introduced @RestController which combined the behavior of @Controller and @ResponseBody together.

It provides an architecture to store and manipulate groups of objects. It allows you to search, sort and manipulate data.

This is a diagram that shows the hierarchy from the root interface: The Collection Interface(java. util. Collection).  From the diagram of the Collection interface we can see three main data structures in List, Queue and Set. All of these data structures are manipulating only with values(the iterator uses index to check or add or retrieve element). The methods that contain the algorithms that perform the computations(sorting, searching, etc…) are polymorphic. One method can be used on many implementations of the right collection Interface. Methods(algorithms) are reusable. This means that we get to work with super arrays. "

Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Beginner’s Guide to Python can be found here Python is one of the languages that is witnessing incredible growth and popularity year by year. In 2017, Stackoverflow calculated that python would beat all other programming languages by 2020 as it has become the fastest-growing programming language in the world. Why is Python so Popular?:  Easy to Learn and Use Python language is incredibly easy to use and learn for new beginners and newcomers. The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available becauseit has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.  Python Has Amazing Libraries When you’re working on bigger projects, libraries can really help you save time and cut down on the initial development cycle. Python has an excellent selection of libraries,from NumPy and SciPy for scientific computing to Django for web development. There are even a few libraries with a more specific focus, like scikit-learn for machine learning applications and nltk for natural language processing.  Python Has Big Data The use of big data and cloud computing solutions in the enterprise world has also helped skyrocket Python to success. It is one of the most popular languages used in datascience, second only to R. It’s also being used for machine learning and AI systems and various modern technologies.  First-choice Language Python language is the first choice for many programmers and students due to the main reason for python being in high demand in the development market. Students and developersalways look forward to learning a language that is in high demand. Python is undoubtedly the hottest cake in the market now.  The Flexibility of Python Language The python language is so flexible that it gives the developer the chance to try something new. The person who is an expert in python language is not just limited to buildsimilar kinds of things but can also go on to try to make something different than before.  Python Has Some Great Corporate Sponsors Google adopted python language way back in 2006 and have used it for many applications and platforms since then. Lots of Institutional effort and money have been devoted tothe training and success of the python language by Google. They have even created a dedicated portal only for python. "

HashSet: HashSet class stores elements in a hash table, and it is best performing implementation of the Set. It does not guarantee the order in which elements are inserted. HashSet allows null values but can not contain duplicate values. Internally uses a HashMap to store the elements.

It is the implementation of LinkedList in the Set Interface. Internally it uses a hash table with linked lists running through it to store the elements. It keeps the insertion order. Example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061import java. util. LinkedHashSet;import java. util.

SortedSet gives functionalities to keep the elements sorted and Navigable gives functionalities to navigate through the TreeSet. Internally it uses a TreeMap to store the elements. TreeSet stores the elements by their natural order(alphabetical or numerical) or based on a custom Comparator that is supplied at the time a TreeSet is created. . You can not have duplicates and null values in TreeSet. It is very useful for storing large amounts of sorted data because it accesses and can retrieve data very fast.

    "body": "2020/10/17 - Definition: A direct quote from the Mozilla developer’s network or MDN  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. In short, it makes your pages feel more dynamic. A webpage generally speaking consists of three key elements:    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): This allows you to create the structure of the web page     CSS (Cascading stylesheet): This is to make that web page look pretty 😊     JavaScript: Allows you to do anything dynamic with the page including fetching data from a server or making the page interactive  History: JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript. It started with the name LiveScript. At the time of creation of JavaScript, Java was a common language, and it was decided to add the word Java to it. It does not have any relationship with Java, in any case. There is a famous/corny saying  Java is to JavaScript as a car is to carpet As it evolved, it got to be known as ECMAScript. The name JavaScript is a trademark owned by Oracle Corp. in the United States. Don’t believe me? Check it out Why is JavaScript popular?: When I say JavaScript is popular, I mean it. According to the Stack Overflow 2019 developer’s survey, it is the most popular language. For 7 years in a row! So what makes it so famous?    It works well with the other two components of a webpage (HTML and CSS)     Minimal learning curve (which has been considered a good or bad for the language)     Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default     Works without any compilation or transpiling     It can run in the browser or server-side. It can run on anything that can support the JavaScript engine (V8, Trident, SpiderMonkey)  Hopefully, by now, I have sold you on the idea of JavaScript and why it is fun to work with. In the next few blog posts, we will go over the basics of running JavaScript and introduction to principles of JavaScript. As we take a deeper dive into these basics, you will also realize that it’s relatively easy to make mistakes if you don’t know what you are doing. We will learn from the mistakes of the past and try to be a better JavaScript developer. "

    "title": "Variable types in JavaScript",
    "body": "2020/10/17 - Anytime that you have a value that could be saved in a variable or passed to a function, they can be defined as one of the 7 types in JavaScript. The different types are:    String (usually for text).   1234567`Mary` is a string surrounded by backticks'John' is a string surrounded by single quotes Parwinder  is a string surrounded by double quotes    All three examples provided above are valid strings. The advantage of using backticks is that it allows you to do multi-line strings. For example,   123456789`This is anexample ofa multiline string`    Another cool thing about backticks is that it allows you to evaluate expressions in them. This allows you to concatenate dynamic values to strings without using the concatenate operator (+);   12345const name =  Parwinder ;console. log(`Hello my name is ${name}`); // Hello my name is Parwinder      Number (for numbers with or without decimals). E. g. 72, or 2. 34 are of number type.   Numbers are not quoted (either by single or double quotes or backticks). JavaScript provides many helper methods to work with number. They are part of Math   1234567891011Math. round(20. 5) =&gt; 21Math. round(20. 1) =&gt; 20Math. floor(20. 7) =&gt; 20Math. ceil(20. 1) =&gt; 21Math. random =&gt; 0. 454646447863 // A random number between 0 and 1    One of the common questions that many interviewers seem to ask about number addition in JavaScript is   123console. log(0. 1 + 0. 2) // 0. 30000000000000004    Yep. It is 0. 30000000000000004 instead of simply being 0. 3. This is because your browser is doing floating point math. To read up more about it go to this link   Also, NaN is a special type of number that stands for not a number. This happens when you do an operation like dividing a number by string.     Boolean is used to represent true or false   The presence of something is true, and the absence is false. It is usually calculated if we are making some comparison. For example, isAge &gt; 19 yields true or false, depending on age.   While we are talking about comparison and boolean. Here is a quick intro to == and ===   12345console. log(10 ==  10 ); // trueconsole. log(10 ===  10 ) // false    == only checks for quality of value where as === checks for equality of value and data type     Null   There are two ways of expressing “nothing” in JS, null and undefined. Null is when we have a property, and we have assigned it a value of null—explicitly stating the value of the property to be nothing.   12345let dog = null;console. log(dog); // null    Fun fact: null has a type of object in JavaScript.     Undefined   In the same spirit of expressing nothing in JS, for JavaScript, when you declare a property but do not assign it any value, it results in undefined.   12345let dog;console. log(dog); // undefined      Symbol is a new addition to JS and it is used to obtain a unique identifier. The Symbol() function returns a value of type symbol. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique. A symbol value is generally used as an identifier for object properties     Object: Objects in JS are special. Everything in JS is an object. It is used to express a collection of data.   123456789101112131415161718192021const person = {  first:  Parwinder ,  last:  Bhagat ,  age: 33}console. log(person. first); // Parwinderconsole. log(person. first); // Bhagatconsole. log(person. first); // 33console. log(person. income); // undefined   "

    "title": "List interface in Java",
    "body": "2020/10/17 - List InterfaceThe List Interface java. util. List represents an ordered list of elements(objects). The elements in the list can be inserted, accessed, iterated and removed by their index (by order in which they appear in the List). Each element has an index. The first element in the list has an index of 0, and the index increments with adding of elements. The list can have duplicate elements. ArrayList, LinkedList and Vector are the three classes that implement the List Interface. ArrayList: ArrayList is the simplest and most often used member of Java Collections Framework. Contrary to Arrays that are fixed, ArrayList can increment and decrement its size when new elements are added or removed. It is a dynamic Array. It allows null values and duplicates. You can retrieve elements by their index that are ordered by their insertion. The ArrayList always manage arrays internally Example: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4]…. . You must use boxed types Integer, Character, etc when creating an ArrayList instead of primitives: int, char, etc…. Creating an ArrayList example: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374757677787980818283import java. util. ArrayList;import java. util. List;  public class ArrayListExample{ Public static void main(String [] args){     // Creating an ArrayList of Strings   List&lt;String&gt; pets = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();  // Adding elements to the list  pets. add( dog );  pets. add( cat );  pets. add( fish );  System. out. println(pets);  pets. add(1, “turtle”);  System. out. println(pets);  //Retrieve element at a given index  String myPet = pets. get(0);     System. out. println(“My pet is a ” + myPet + “. ”);  //Remove element at a given index   pets. remove(3);     System. out. println(pets);  //Iterating over an ArrayList   for(String allPets : pets){    System. out. println(allPets)   }  }}Output: [dog, cat, fish] [dog, turtle, cat, fish] My pet is a dog. [dog, turtle, cat] [dog, turtle, cat] These are the basic and most used methods for adding, removing and retrieving elements in an ArrayList. You can check if the List is empty with isEmpty(); method, the size of the list size(); remove an object remove (Object obj); Get the first or last element getFirst(); getLast(); Check if the list contains some element contains(); and many more methods. LinkedList: LinkedList implements the List interface same as the ArrayList and they are very similar to use. The difference between them is the way they store the elements and the way they link to the elements. LinkedList stores the elements in a double links list. Every element is pointing to the next and the previous element. Example: [0] =&gt; [1] =&gt; [2] =&gt; [3] =&gt; [4] 1      [0] &lt;= [1] &lt;= [2] &lt;= [3] &lt;= [4]LinkedList has a better performance on add() and remove() than ArrayList because there is no shifting of the elements but is slower on get() and set() methods. LinkedList maintains insertion order, and can have null and duplicate values. LinkedList Implements the List Interface, but also implements the Queue Interface, that adds additional methods such as offer(), poll(), peek(), Creating a LinkedList example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485import java. util. LinkedList;import java. util. ArrayList;import java. util. List;  public class LinkedListExample{ Public static void main(String [] args){     // Creating a LinkedList of Strings   List&lt;String&gt; pets = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;();  // Adding elements to the list   pets. add( dog );  pets. add( cat );  pets. add( fish );  System. out. println(pets);  pets. add(1, “turtle”);  System. out. println(pets);  //Retrieve element at a given index  String myPet = pets. get(0);     System. out. println(“My pet is a ” + myPet + “. ”);  //Remove element at a given index   pets. remove(3);     System. out. println(pets);  //Iterating over an LinkedList   for(String allPets : pets){    System. out. println(allPets)   }  }}Output: [dog, cat, fish] [dog, turtle, cat, fish] My pet is a dog. [dog, turtle, cat] [dog, turtle, cat] Vector: Vector is almost identical to an ArrayList, they are similar to use.  The difference is that ArrayList is not synchronized and the Vector is synchronized. The ArrayList increases its capacity by 50% and Vector increases its capacity by 100% if their number of elements exceeds its capacity. Vector is slow because it is synchronized. ArrayList is more commonly used over Vector because you can synchronize it by yourelves. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667mport java. util. *;public class VectorExample {  public static void main(String args[]) {   /* Vector of initial capacity(size) of 2 */   Vector&lt;String&gt; vec = new Vector&lt;String&gt;(2);   /* Adding elements to a vector*/   vec. addElement( Apple );   vec. addElement( Orange );   vec. addElement( Mango );   vec. addElement( Fig );   /* check size and capacityIncrement*/   System. out. println( Size is:  +vec. size());   System. out. println( Default capacity increment is:  +vec. capacity());   vec. addElement( fruit1 );   vec. addElement( fruit2 );   vec. addElement( fruit3 );   /*size and capacityIncrement after two insertions*/   System. out. println( Size after addition:  +vec. size());   System. out. println( Capacity after increment is:  +vec. capacity());   /*Display Vector elements*/   Enumeration en = vec. elements();   System. out. println( \nElements are: );   while(en. hasMoreElements())     System. out. print(en. nextElement() +    );  }}Output: Size is: 4 Default capacity increment is: 4 Size after addition: 7 Capacity after increment is: 8 Elements are: Apple Orange Mango Fig fruit1 fruit2 fruit3 "

In this post you’ll learn how to list the correct job pods - all of them, and how to retrieve the job logs - from the current completed pod and from a pods that exited with error. Given you already have a Kubernetes cluster, and the job was deployed in a namespace, this is what you want to do.

    "body": "2020/07/15 - Properly delete an element from a slice in GoArrays and slices in Go are a bit different from analogous structrures in other languages (like list in Python). An arrays is contigious container that holds the values, while the slice just holds pointers to the start and the end of a region of the container that we’re concerned about. Learn more about slices and arrays in Go here. This makes deleting a value from a slice a bit tricky. There are two ways this can be achieved, depending on whether we want to keep the order of values in the array or not. If we want to keep the order of the values, we can slice the array up to the element we want to remove, then append all elements after the that: 12345678910111213141516171819arr := []string{ a ,  b ,  c ,  d ,  e ,  f }// we want to remove the thrid element  c i := 2arr = append(arr[:i], arr[i+1:]. . . )fmt. Println(arr)// [a b d e f]Note that we used the expansion expression . . . and we’re adding the elements from the slice. This gets the job done, but is not very efficient. However the order of the elements will be preserved. If we don’t care about the order of elements, we can swap the element we want to remove with the last element of the slice, then make the slice to be one element shorter: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425arr := []string{ a ,  b ,  c ,  d ,  e ,  f }// we want to remove the thrid element  c i := 2arr[i] = arr[len(arr) - 1]arr = arr[:len(arr) - 1]fmt. Println(arr)// [a b f d e]//  c  is not in the slice, but the order is not preservedThis approach is much faster than the previous approach, but does not preserve the order of elements. What is happening behind the scene: remember that in Go, arrays are the container holding the values, and the slice is just a structure that points to the start and the end of the part of the array we’re concerned about? In the second case what we did was the following: We started with something like this: 1234567891011  array: [ a ][ b ][ c ][ d ][ e ][ f ]    ↑             ↑    | ┌-----------------------┘slice (0, 5) start at 0 and end at 5the slice starts at the 0th element and ends at the 5th element. The array is the background container holding the values. After we swap out “c” with “f”, we then set the slice end at 4 and end up with something likie this: 123456789101112131415          ┌---- swap ----┐          ↓       ↓array: [ a ][ b ][ f ][ d ][ e ][ c ]    ↑           ↑    | ┌------------------┘slice (0, 4) start at 0 and end at 4Now the slice ends at the 4th element. Note that the array still holds 6 values, however our slice only “sees” 5. "

    "body": "2020/07/02 - NaN and Infinity in JavaYou may be familiar with the fact that you cannot divide an integer with 0 in Java - it yields java. lang. ArithmeticException: / by zero. But what happens when we try to do this with floating point numbers. Let’s give it a try: 12345678910111213141516171819int m = 10, n = 0;System. out. println(m/n);// Exception: java. lang. ArithmeticException: / by zerofloat a = 10. 0f, b = 0. 0f;System. out. println(a/b);// InfinityNow that is interesting, we didn’t get an exception, but instead, we got something as a result: Infinity. If we check out the Float class, we can see that there are a couple of constants defined in the class:    NaN - A constant holding a Not-a-Number (NaN) value of type float.     PositiveInfinity - A constant holding the positive infinity of type float.     NegativeInfinity - A constant holding the negative infinity of type float.  What this means is, that some operations in Java may yield values that are not strictly some defined number and behave in a special way. For example, when we’re diving by 0, we usually say that the result is Infinity. In maths, this has a special meaning, in terms that Infinity is not a specific number and has a set of rules defined for it. In Java, we can see that there are two types of infinity: positive and negative. To get a positive infinity, it means that the result of some operation approaches infinite value, but from the positive side on the number axis - for example if we divide a positive number by 0, we get infinite results but all of them are positive, thus getting positive infinity. On the other hand, if we divide a negative number by 0, we also get infinite results, but all of them are negative, so negative infinity. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829float a = 1. 0f;float b = 0. 0f;System. out. println((a/b) == Float. POSITIVE_INFINITY);// true// if a is negativea = -1. 0f;System. out. println((a/b) == Float. POSITIVE_INFINITY);// false, we should be getting negative infinitySystem. out. println((a/b) == Float. NEGATIVE_INFINITY);// trueBut what happens when both of the numbers are 0? In maths, dividing zero by zero yields an undefined result. In Java we get NaN. This is also a constant defined in Float and Double classes. If we try to divide zero by zero, we get something that is not a number, so NaN. 123456789101112131415161718192021float a = 0. 0f;float b = 0. 0f;Float c = a/b;System. out. println(c);// NaNSystem. out. println(c == Float. NaN);// falseSystem. out. println(c. isNaN());// trueNow, this looks weird. Why isn’t the result (c), which is clearly NaN, not equal to that constant? This also comes from maths, where we cannot compare two things that are not numbers. We can only compare something that has a clear definition or has a clear value. NaN denotes a mathematically undefined value, and as such we cannot compare it (similar to NULL in SQL). What we can do, is to check whether whatever we got is undefined (Not-a-Number) by using Float. isNaN() method. Some notes on serialization: When serializing special care should be taken to serialize these values properly. If we do naive serialization, we would get an exception: 1234567Gson gson = new Gson();System. out. println(gson. toJson(new SomeObject(10. 0f/0. 0f)));// Throws an exception: java. lang. IllegalArgumentException: Infinity is not a valid double value as per JSON specification. To override this behavior, use GsonBuilder. serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues() method. By setting the serialization of these values, we get the following: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061public static class SomeObject {  private float value;  public SomeObject(float value) {    this. value = value;  }  public float getValue() {    return value;  }  public void setValue(float value) {    this. value = value;  }}. . . GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();builder. serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues();Gson gson = builder. create();System. out. println(gson. toJson(new SomeObject(10. 0f/0. 0f)));// { value :Infinity}System. out. println(gson. toJson(new SomeObject(-10. 0f/0. 0f)));// { value :-Infinity}System. out. println(gson. toJson(new SomeObject(0. 0f/0. 0f)));// { value :NaN}Be careful though, these values may not be recognized by some JSON parsers and you may get some unpredictable results, such as the values to be converted to String or getting an error while parsing.

Maybe you are trying to install a Python module that takes some time before installing the dependencies e. g: 12345install:  pip install torchor you are running the Java project tests e. g 12345script:  mvn package -Dtestng=test. xmlor pushing a new image to the Docker registry e. g 12345script:  docker push $APPLICATION:$IMAGE_VERSION;The default Travis job timeout is set to 10 min, so in some scenarios the above commands will fail with: 123Timeout (20 minutes) reached. Terminating  . . .  To increase the timeouts travis ci offers a function that will increase the build timeouts: 123install: travis_wait N mvn installThe travis_wait n where the n is the minutes by which the waiting time is increased.  Note: You must carefully use travis_wait since it can extend the build time when there could happen another issue. "

    "body": "2020/06/17 - Imagine a complex project where you have a lot of code. Having everything written in a single Python file will become un-maintainable, too complex and hard to debug. To have an abstraction layer that will provide separation of the code in different parts that can be reusable would be a great advantage. So, for example, to import one file into another and reuse classes and functions from it. Python already provides that abstraction by using the modules. Adding the import statement in the Python file means you are using the modules. Let’s check that with a simple code example. The following directory contains two Python files: 12345├── modulea. py├── moduleb. pyThe modulea contains one function e. g 12345def my_awesome_number(number):  print(f'The awesome number is {number}'. )Now, let’s import modulea in moduleb 1234567891011121314151617# other imports could be included too e. g from random import random # pyhthon module for generating random numbers# import the moduleaimport moduleadef random_number():  numb = random()  modulea. my_awesome_print(numb)What happens when we import modulea in moduleb? The import modulea will look in:    The same directory for the file with the name modulea. py.     The list of directories in the PYTHONPATH.     The installation default directory.  and will raise ModuleNotFound error if the modulea isn’t found. In this example, it will be found and will be executed by the Python interpreter in isolated scope. Next, the random module will be executed too and all of the (classes, functions, variables) in our example my_awesome_number function from modulea will be stored in the module’s dictionary and be available for use through the module’s namespace. The functions from the imported module will be executed only the first time when the module is imported. The imported modules as random and modulea are isolated in the module namespace to avoid the naming collision. In short that is what happens when you import the module. So, with the simple words, we can explain the Python modules as files with the suffix . py that contains Python statements. They as building blocks will provide code simplicity, better maintainability and reusability, so always prefer to use them. To check all of the available built in Python modules check Python Module Index "

Assigning the 0 value to sum, iterate over each n element and add it to the sum and lastly return the sum. Is there some mathematical notation that can describe this? Yes, that is the Big O notation. You can simply describe the efficiency of the algorithm with Big O notation. The Big O notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm according to the run time and space requirements when the different input size is used. Let me show you how it might look with code. 1234567891011def find_awesome_user(users):  for user in users:    if user. city == 'awesome city':      return user  return 'Not found'Before we found the user from an awesome city some number of checks must be performed. The user that we are looking can be the last in the list so we need to iterate through all of them which would be the worst-case scenario. Finding the user from the awesome city on the first iteration would be our best-case scenario. If we have the 50 users our average case scenario would fall somewhere in the middle, around 25 users. So, by analyzing the time complexity of the above function you can think of the best, average and worst-case scenarios. Big O notation measures the worst-case scenario. You can describe the complexity of this function as a linear because of the steps required to complete the execution of the function increase or decrease linearly with the number of users. You can say that the efficiency of the function is about O(n). Sometimes, an algorithm needs to perform a linear time operation for each value in the input data for e. g 1234567for x in data:  for y in data:    print(x, y)In this case, it is a quadratic time complexity O(n2). But what if the function doesn’t depend on the input data? In that case, we can say that it has a constant time O(1). 1234567def find_first(users):  #imagine the users were sorted by id  return users[0]This function doesn’t depend on the input data size, because it always gets the first user from the list. By looking at the above examples maybe you can think of a use case where some algorithm has multiple complexities e. g O(n) + O(n2) + O(n!) etc. So, how can you calculate them, is just by describing the largest complexity of that algorithm. In the above example as O(n!) which is a factorial time complexity that grows in a factorial way.  For additional information on the Big O complexity of most common algorithms in the computer science check bigocheatsheet. "

Literals in Java are primitive data types (like int, float, boolean and sometimes String) which are not instantiated using the new keyword, like these int i = 10; or String str =  foo ;. Notice that there is no new keyword before any of these. When defined like this, Java considers these values as constants and keeps them in a special place in the jvm memory used for constants. The idea behind this is a form of optimization - whenever Java encounters the same value in the code, it does not allocate new memory on the heap, but instead will reuse the value that already has in the static memory. However, if we create new values using the new keyword, we’re instructing the jvm to actually allocate new slot on the heap for our value: String str = new String( foo );. By now you may have some idea of what is going on: 123456789101112131415String a =  foo ; // this is a literal and goes in the static memoryString b =  foo ; // also a literal, with same value as 'a', so 'b' points to the same          // memory location as 'a'String c = new String( foo ) // We allocate  foo  on the heap, although it has the               // same value as 'a' and 'b', it is in a different               // memory location - namely on the heapWhen doing == comparison in Java, by default the jvm compares memory locations - it will compare whether the memory address of the two objects is the same, and if it is, then the objects must be the same. But the strings allocated with new will always get new locations on the Heap, and == will get two different memory locations and will evaluate to false. The way around this is to use String. equals method. This method compares the string content, and not the memory addresses. And that is what we want when comparing strings. Here is some weirdness and examples on how to compare string and what not to do: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243String a =  foo ;String b =  foo ; a == b // -&gt; true, but don't do this. a. equals(b) // true. Do this instead. String a =  foo ;String b = new String( foo )a == b // false. One is a string literal, the other is a regular object on the heap. a. equals(b) // true. Compares the content:  foo  is equal to  foo . // Alternative approach, with Objects. equalsObjects. equals( foo ,  foo )        // trueObjects. equals( foo , null)        // true. Protects us from null pointer dereferencing. Objects. equals( foo , new String( foo ))  // trueSo basically we want to use String. equals to compare the content of the strings. However in some cases we may run into problems, namely in the cases when we try to call equals from a variable that is null: 123456789String a = null;a. equals( foo ); // NullPointerExceptionSo in cases when we’re comparing with a literal, always call equals from the literal: 1234567String a = null; foo . equals(a)  // false. No exception was thrown. Alternatively you can use Objects. equals (available from java 1. 7). This does what we want and takes care of the null values. 1234567String a = null;Objects. equals(a,  foo ) // false. no exception thrown. "

However, a cron job is any defined task to run in a given time period. It can be a shell script or a simple bash command. Cron job helps us automate our routine tasks, it can be hourly, daily, monthly, etc. Meanwhile, the crontab stands for cron table. It is a Linux system file that contains a list of the cron job. We define our task — bash command, shell script, Python script, etc scheduled in crontab. Check cron service on Linux system: 123sudo systemctl status crond. serviceUnderstand a cron job syntax: Cron job syntax on crontab.    crontab -a : create a new as crontab file     crontab -e: edit our crontab file or create one if it doesn’t already exist     crontab -l: show up our crontab file     crontab -r: delete our crontab file     crontab -v: show up the last time we have edited our crontab file  minute(s) hour(s) day(s) month(s) weekday(s) command(s) Note: day names 0–6 begin with Sunday.

Depending on what we need, we can do one of the following: Undo all changes in the last commit: To undo all changes made in the last commit, and go back to an earlier commit, we can use git revert. Let’s say we have some repository, and we committed something by mistake: 12345678910111213$ git log --oneline cba9069 (HEAD -&gt; master) Oops, this change is a mistake &lt;-- We want to revert this commit5b7794b Some stable changese57b197 Adds some content187ea9d Initial commitThen, to revert the latest commit, we can use git revert &lt;commit sha&gt;: 123git revert cba9069This will pop up our favorite editor to enter the revert commit message and will create a new commit, which reverts all changes in the given commit. After the command is complete, the repository history will look like this: 12345678910111213$ git log --oneline 0ed5618 (HEAD -&gt; master) Revert  Oops, this change is a mistake   &lt;-- this reverts all changes from cba9069cba9069 Oops, this change is a mistake5b7794b Some stable changes  &lt;-- The final state of the repository will be the same as in this commite57b197 Adds some content187ea9d Initial commitAs you can see, there is an additional commit that reverted our changes and the final state of the repository is the same as the state it had in the previous commit (the commit before the one we wanted to revert). This is useful when we want to keep the repository history and it is the recommended way of doing things. The upside is that we haven’t lost any data, even if we change our mind later, we can always revert again or see the changes in the reverted commit - it’s all there in the history. Reset the changes, modify and commit again: Sometimes we don’t want to revert everything, but instead we need to make just a couple of changes and commit again. In these situations we can use git reset --soft &lt;commit-ref&gt;: Given the same state of the repository: 12345678910111213$ git log --oneline cba9069 (HEAD -&gt; master) Oops, this change is a mistake &lt;-- We want to make some changes here again and commit5b7794b Some stable changese57b197 Adds some content187ea9d Initial commitThen we can do: 123git reset --soft HEAD^This makes a soft reset to the commit that is parent of the current HEAD (the current HEAD is what we want to change). Soft reset means that Git will undo the changes of the commit in the following way:    The HEAD of the repository will now point to 5b7794b Some stable changes (HEAD^ - one up from current HEAD)     The changes introduced in the faulty commit are not lost, but are staged in the repository  This gives us the opportunity to redo the changes and commit again. Doing a git status to see the changes we see something like this: 12345678910111213$ git status On branch masterChanges to be committed: (use  git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;. . .   to unstage)	modified:  README. mdAnd the history log: 1234567891011$ git log --oneline 5b7794b (HEAD -&gt; master) Some stable changese57b197 Adds some content187ea9d Initial commitThis is exactly what we wanted. After doing the changes we can commit: 1234567891011121314151617$ git commit -m  Fixed the commit $ git log --oneline55293e6 (HEAD -&gt; master) Fixed the commit5b7794b Some stable changese57b197 Adds some content187ea9d Initial commitGetting rid of the commit completely: Sometimes we want to get rid of the commit completely. Maybe we have committed some sensitive data by mistake (like an access key or password), and we want no trace of it in the history. In those cases, we can rebase the branch and drop the commits we don’t want. Again starting with the same repository, we can rebase on the parent commit of the good commit (going 2 commits back, because we cannot drop a commit if there is just one commit in the rebase list): 12345678910111213$ git log --oneline cba9069 (HEAD -&gt; master) Oops, this change is a mistake &lt;-- We want this gone5b7794b Some stable changese57b197 Adds some content &lt;-- we pass this commit to the rebase command, so we have 2 commits in the list187ea9d Initial commitRebase: 123git rebase -i e57b197In the rebase editor: 12345pick 5b7794b Some stable changes &lt;-- we want to keep thisdrop cba9069 Oops, this change is a mistake &lt;-- but we want to drop thisSave, and commit. The final state of the repository: 123456789$ git log --oneline 5b7794b (HEAD -&gt; master) Some stable changese57b197 Adds some content187ea9d Initial commitAnd there are no changes staged for commit: 1234567$ git status On branch masternothing to commit, working tree cleanImportant Note: This will completely remove any trace of the commit, so once done, it is very hard to get those changes back if we change our mind later on. We should use this approach only if we are certain that we want that commit completely gone. Final notes: When using approaches 2 and 3 (using reset and rebase), we’re making changes in the repository graph itself. While locally this is absolutely fine, there might be a problem when we’re having a remote repository. When the commit we want to revert is on the remote repository as well, then the two repositories will have different graphs and we cannot push our changes in a straight forward manner without Git complaining that the branches have diverged. Approach 1 however, when using git revert, adds an additional commit, just like a regular commit, which then can be easily pushed to the remote repository. "

Some branches will be merged into the master branch and some are no longer necessary. In either case, at some point they need to be deleted. We want to keep the repository clean and neat after all. Deleting a local branch in a Git repository is quite straight forward. You can use either of these commands to do it: 12345git branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt;git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;To delete a branch in the remote repository, you can do something very similar: 1234567891011git push -d &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch_name&gt;# &lt;remote&gt; is the remote name, very often 'origin'git push -d origin &lt;branch_name&gt;The difference between -d and -D: Both -d and -D are aliases:  -d is an alias for --delete. This deletes a branch only if the branchhas already been fully merged in its upstream branch. This is very useful when using git workflows, to prevent unintentional mistakes of deleting a branch that is intended to be merged. Once merged, however, the branch can be safely deleted.  -D is shortcut for --delete --force. This deletes the branch regardlessof the merge state of the branch. This is useful for deleting branches that are not expected to be merged. ## Deleting remote branch on Github repository Very often you need to remove a branch on a remote repository on Github. The regular process of creating a Pull Request, once the branch has been merged, offers an action to delete the branch via the web interface: In the branch that should be deleted was not merged via Pull Request, then you can remove it from the command line by pushing to the remote repository: 123 git push -d origin &lt;branch_name&gt;"

    "body": "2020/05/12 - How to remove a specific item from a list (array) in JavascriptRemoving an element by value from an array is a very common task in day to day coding. Javascript Arays do not directly expose method to do this by element value, however this can easily be achieved using the splice method: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223let vegetables = ['Cabbage', 'Turnip', 'Radish', 'Carrot']console. log(vegetables)// [ Cabbage ,  Turnip ,  Radish ,  Carrot ]// Remove  Radish let removedItem = vegetables. splice(vegetables. indexOf('Radish'), 1) // this is how to remove an itemconsole. log(vegetables)// [ Cabbage ,  Turnip ,  Carrot ]console. log('Removed item:', removedItem)// Removed Item: RadishThe splice approach is the recommended way of removing an element in Javascript (See “Common Operations” on MDN). The splice method changes the content of the array by removing (and/or replacing) elements in the array, at the given position. The first argument to splice is the position (0-based) of the first element to be removed, and the second argument is the number of elements to be removed from the array starting at that position. By setting 1 as the second argument, only the element at the given position will be removed. An important thing to note is that this approach mutates the array. Remove an element by value without modifying the original array: To remove an element without modifying the original array, we can use slice to slice the array into two sub-arrays and then concatenate them both into one array: 123456789101112131415161718192021let vegetables = ['Cabbage', 'Turnip', 'Radish', 'Carrot']let pos = vegetables. indexOf('Radish') // get the position of the element we want to removelet vegetablesNoRadish = vegetables. slice(0, pos). concat(vegetables. slice(pos + 1))console. log(vegetablesNoRadish)// [ Cabbage ,  Turnip ,  Carrot ]// The original array is unchangedconsole. log(vegetables)// [ Cabbage ,  Turnip ,  Radish ,  Carrot ]Remove all elements with the same value from the array: To remove all elements in the array that have the given value, we can use method filter: 12345678910111213let vegetables = ['Cabbage', 'Turnip', 'Radish', 'Carrot', 'Radish']let vegetablesNoRadish = vegetables. filter(function(val) {  return val !== 'Radish';})console. log(vegetablesNoRadish)// [ Cabbage ,  Turnip ,  Carrot ]Using ECMA Script 6: 1234567891011let vegetables = ['Cabbage', 'Turnip', 'Radish', 'Carrot', 'Radish']let vegetablesNoRadish = vegetables. filter(val =&gt; val !== 'Radish')console. log(vegetablesNoRadish)// [ Cabbage ,  Turnip ,  Carrot ]The approaches above work for most of the popular browsers and in NodeJS environments.
