<h1 id="git-delete-a-branch-from-the-local-and-remote-repository">Git delete a branch from the local and remote repository</h1>

<p>While working with Git repositories, very often you will create and need to delete
a lot of branches. Some branches will be merged into the master branch and some are
no longer necessary. In either case, at some point they need to be deleted. We want
to keep the repository clean and neat after all.</p>

<p>Deleting a local branch in a Git repository is quite straight forward. You can use
either of these commands to do it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>git branch <span class="nt">-d</span> &lt;branch_name&gt;
git branch <span class="nt">-D</span> &lt;branch_name&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To delete a branch in the remote repository, you can do something very similar:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>git push <span class="nt">-d</span> &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch_name&gt;

<span class="c"># &lt;remote&gt; is the remote name, very often 'origin'</span>

git push <span class="nt">-d</span> origin &lt;branch_name&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-difference-between--d-and--d">The difference between <code class="highlighter-rouge">-d</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-D</code></h2>

<p>Both <code class="highlighter-rouge">-d</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-D</code> are aliases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-d</code> is an alias for <code class="highlighter-rouge">--delete</code>. This deletes a branch <strong>only</strong> if the branch
 has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. This is very useful when
 using <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows">git workflows</a>,
 to prevent unintentional mistakes of deleting a branch that is intended to be merged.
 Once merged, however, the branch can be safely deleted.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-D</code> is shortcut for <code class="highlighter-rouge">--delete</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">--force</code>. This deletes the branch regardless
 of the merge state of the branch. This is useful for deleting branches that are
 not expected to be merged.</li>
</ul>

<p>## Deleting remote branch on Github repository</p>

<p>Very often you need to remove a branch on a remote repository on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>The regular process of creating a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">Pull Request</a>,
 once the branch has been merged, offers an action to delete the branch via the web
 interface:</p>

<p><img src="images/pr-merged-delete-branch.png" alt="Safely Delete Branch" /></p>

<p>In the branch that should be deleted was not merged via <em>Pull Request</em>, then you can 
 remove it from the command line by pushing to the remote repository:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre> git push <span class="nt">-d</span> origin &lt;branch_name&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>
