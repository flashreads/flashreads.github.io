<h2 id="what-is-binary-search-trees">What is Binary search Trees?</h2>

<p>Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:</p>

<p>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. 
There must be no duplicate nodes.</p>

<p>###Pros of a BST</p>

<ul>
  <li>When balanced, a BST provides lightning-fast O(log(n)) insertions, deletions, and lookups.</li>
  <li>Binary search trees are pretty simple. An ordinary BST, unlike a balanced tree like a red-black tree, requires very little code to get running.</li>
</ul>

<p>###Cons of a BST</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slow for a brute-force search. If you need to iterate over each node, you might have more success with an array.</li>
  <li>When the tree becomes unbalanced, all fast O(log(n)) operations quickly degrade to O(n).</li>
  <li>Since pointers to whole objects are typically involved, a BST can require quite a bit more memory than an array, although this depends on the implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many applications of binary search trees in real life, and one of the most common use cases is storing indexes and keys in a database. For example, when you create a primary key column in MySQL or PostgresQL, you create a binary tree where the keys are the values of the column and the nodes point to database rows. This allows the application to easily search for database rows by specifying a key, for example, to find a user record using the email primary key.</p>
