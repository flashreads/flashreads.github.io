## Python Requests Library

Sometimes we need with a script written in Python accessing to an API or download the content of a web page.

For that we can use the [Requests Library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest)

First we need to install the library:

```console
pip install requests
```

Code Example : 

```python

import requests

# The requests module provides us different methods (get, post, update, delete)
r = requests.get('http://www.google.com')

# In the request method also it is possible to specify the headers, the cookies and the data sent
headers = { 'accept' : '*/*' }
payload = { 'title' : 'Download web page with python' }
cookies = dict(example_cookie='value')

r = requests.post('https://reqres.in/api/posts', data=payload, headers=headers, cookies=cookies)

# With the object returned 
# We could check the status code of the response
r.status_code

# We could obtain the content of the page as a string
r.text

# Or if the url is an API, we could obtain the response in json format
r.json()


```
