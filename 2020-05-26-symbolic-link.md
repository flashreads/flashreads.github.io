# Symbolic Link

## What is Symbolic Link?
A symlink or a Symbolic Link is simply enough a shortcut to another file. It is a file that points to another file.

## How to create a Symbolic Link?
Files is a symbolic link to /images/files/prod/files. When you access files or anything inside it, you'll really access the path under /images. Symbolic links are made and updated using the ln command. This link could have been made with:

```
ln -s /images/files/prod/files files
```
-s means to make a symbolic link. To update a link, either delete the link and create it as above, or use the -f option to ln as well. If you are linking to a folder, you should include the -n option:

```
ln -sfn /a/new/path files
```

This will replace the link with a new one pointing at /a/new/path.

The -n option is necessary when linking to a different target folder to avoid creating a sub-folder inside that symbolic link and instead replace the symbolic link completely.
