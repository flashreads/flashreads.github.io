<img src="./images/git-and-github.jpeg" alt="git vs github">



If you have worked on coding projects you might came across these terms but many new developers get confused between git and GitHub. They are not same though they are connected with each other. Let's see some differences.



## Git

**Git** is a Version control system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. It helps in comparing, differentiating and reverting the changes between two versions of the project. It really helpful in preventing conflicts specially when a lot of people are working on one larger project.



## Github

**GitHub** is a Web-based Git version control repository hosting service. Github is designed to manage open-source projects that are using git. It provides features like : creating a branch, creating a Pull Request, raising issues, etc.
