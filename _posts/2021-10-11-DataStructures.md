## Basic data structures:

Python has four basic structure namely Lists,Dictionary,Tuple and sets.

These data structures are in built that come along with python and we also have user defined data structure.





## List:

Lists are the type of container which can store data of different types in the memory.Lists are created using '[]'(square braces)

Example:

```python

l1=[34,56,78,'list',(2,3)]

```

## Sets:

Sets are again similar to lists and tuples but diffrence would be it does not store duplicate values.It is enclosed in curly braces{}

Example:

```python

s1={2,45,(4.5,7),s}

```

## Tuple:

Tuple is similar to Lists but the diffrence is tuples are immutable where lists are mutable.Tuples are created using round braces()

Example:

```python

t1=(1,2,3,(67,78),'tuple')

```

## Dictionary:

Okay now dictionary are not at all like lists. These data structures store key-value pair. Take an anology of a dictionary where there is a word and a meaning to that. Dictionaries in python are created using curly braces.

Example:

```python

d1={1:a,2:b,3:c}

```

Some of the user defined data structures are as follows:

## Array: 

These data structures are similar to lists but it is homogeneous that is the elements having same datatype.



## Linked list:

These are the data structure that holds the value of next element using pointers.



## Stack:

These data structure follow the principle of last in first out. Basically, we can access only the last entered value. We can also do operations like push or pop.



## Queue:

These are the data structures that work following the principle of first in first out. You totally relate it to a queue in real life.



## Hash maps:

Hash maps are same as dictionaries in python.



## Graph:

Graphs stores the data in the collection of points called vertices and edges.
