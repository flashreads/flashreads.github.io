# Generate a random integer within specific range in Java



Very often you need to generate a random number within some range.

Java offers a [`Random.nextInt(int bound)`]() method, which gives you a random integer between `0` (inclusive) and the `bound` (exclusive).



We can use this method to generate a random number between `a` and `b`:



```java

public static int nextRandomIntBetween(int a, int b) {

    if (b <= a) {

        throw new IllegalArgumentException("b must be greater than a");

    }

    int m = b - a;

    Random random = new Random();

    return random.nextInt(m) + a;

}

```



First, we must ensure that `b` is greater than `a`. `nextInt(int bound)` does not accept negative values.

Then, we calculate the difference `b - a`. This is the range of our random integers and we can use this

to generate random number between 0 and `b - a`.

Finally, we add the value of `a` to the random number, which will make the random number exactly in the range

we wanted.



Here is the full example:



```java

package com.flashreads.examples;



import java.security.SecureRandom;

import java.util.Base64;

import java.util.Random;



public class RandomNumberWithinRangeExample {



    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Here are 10 numbers between 5 (inclusive) and 8 (exclusive):");

        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

            System.out.println(nextRandomIntBetween(5, 8));

        }



    }





    public static int nextRandomIntBetween(int a, int b) {

        if (b <= a) {

            throw new IllegalArgumentException("b must be greater than a");

        }

        int m = b - a;

        Random random = new Random();

        return random.nextInt(m) + a;

    }

}



```



Output:



```

Here are 10 numbers between 5 (inclusive) and 8 (exclusive):
