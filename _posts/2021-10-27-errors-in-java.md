# ERRORS



`Error` results in abnormal working of the program. Some errors dont let the program to be compiled meanwhile some errors occur during execution after succesful compilation. Based on this factor errors are classified into three main types.



## Types Of Errors



There are three types of errors in Java



1. Syntax errors

2. Logical errors

3. Runtime errors (Exception)



### 1. Syntax errors



These are the errors which occur when our compiler finds violation of Java syntax in our program. It is also called as compile time error as it is detected by the compiler.



Example:

```java



public static void main(String args[]){



    //Semicolon missing



    int a=9   // semicolon missing

    int b=3+a;



    System.print.println(b);



    // Datatype missing



      d=3456;



}

```





### 2. Logical errors



These are also called as bugs. This occurs when the program compiles and runs but the expected output is not received when certain input is given. These happen due to not using appropriate logic in the program by the user.



Example:



```java

public static void main(String args[]){

    

    // Find product of a and b

    int a = 34;

    int b=0;



    

    int c= a/b;



    System.out.println("product of a and b is"+c);



    //But here c is the quotient not the product of a and b

}

```





### 3. Runtime errors



These errors are encountered while the program is executing. They get successfully compiled but throw an exception while running. These are also called `Exceptions`. They are hard to find as compiler doesnt point at the line where the error as ocurred.



Example:



```java

public static void main(String args[]){

    

    //Number divided by 0 is not defined

    int a = 34;

    int b=0;



    int c= a/b;



    System.out.println(c);

}

```
