# A simple Guide to FTP connection 

 

FTP

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.



The client can send FTP commands such as STAT, PWD, RETR, and STOR. The ftplib module has multiple methods that can wrap these commands.



# Example



Create a send_command.py script and write the following content in it:



```python

    import os

    import ftplib



    ftp_host='xxx'

    ftp_user_name='xxx'

    ftp_password='xxx'



    session = ftplib.FTP(ftp_host,ftp_user_name,ftp_password)

    # file to send

    file = open('origin_filename.txt','rb')

    # send the file

    session.storbinary('STOR 'end_filename.txt', file)



    # close file and FTP

    file.close()

    session.quit()

```



Run the script as follows:



```

    python3 send_command.py

```
