# React JS Components



## React JS



React is a Javascript library created by Facebook in 2013. It is used to create user interfaces and UI components. React JS is a popular library used by companies such as Reddit, Salesforce, Hulu, and Netflix due to its ability to create fast and dynamic websites.



## Components



A component is a reusable peice of code. Much like a function, it is able to take in an input (props) to generate an output (React element).



In the example below, the `name` prop is passed into the Greeting component so that the Greeting component

can be reused multiple times with different names without repeating code.



```JSX

import React from "react";



const Greeting = ({ name }) => {

  return (

    <h1>Hello {name}, I hope you're having a great day!</h1>

    );

};



export default Greeting;

```



Here is an example of the Greeting component being invoked with different names:



```JSX

import React from 'react';

import Greeting from './Greeting';



const App = () => {

    return (

        <div>

            <Greeting name="Alex"/>

            <Greeting name="Rachel"/>

            <Greeting name="John"/>

            <Greeting name="Sammie"/>

        </div>

    );

};



export default App

```
