# Getting Started with CSS Flexbox



Flexbox is a layout method that consists of boxes that ... flex. Content is organized into boxes that can be scaled up and down and can be placed in rows and columns.



## What is CSS Flexbox?



Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout. That is, its properties and specifications are related to rows or columns. This is different from a CSS grid that has both rows and columns in two dimensions at the same time. You can use Flexbox to create grid layouts by nesting containers and elements.



## How to Use Flexbox

Flexbox consists of a alot of properties, the first step is using Flexbox is by invoking it with the display property.





```CSS

 display : flex;

```

Then we have the "flex-direction" property tells your container which direction its items should go in and therefore also says which direction the main-axis is going in. for example :-



```CSS

 flex-direction : column;

```

We also have the "flex-wrap" property which tells your code whether its items are allowed to wrap to the next line, like the lines on the page of a book, or whether they need to stay forced onto one line. an example is :- 



```CSS

 flex-wrap : wrap;

```
